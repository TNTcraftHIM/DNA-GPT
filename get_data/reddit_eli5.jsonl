{"question": "ELI5: Why is torsion in horses still as deadly now as it was back in the 1930s despite advancements in veterinary medicine?", "human_answer": "Dogs can also have torsion, and it\u2019s particularly common in some breeds. I have lost two standard poodles to bloat, despite immediate medical care. One dog bloated twice; the first time, the vet was able to de-torse her, but the second, the torsion had already caused her stomach to begin dying. The other dog could only have been potentially saved with a specialized surgery that our emergency vet did not know how to perform, and we wouldn\u2019t have had time to get her to another surgeon before her stomach died. \n\nBloat is horrible and strikes frighteningly fast. My second dog went from fine at 9pm to gone at 11pm. I was home and around her all evening, and the instant she started biting at her sides, I knew exactly what it was and rushed her immediately to the vet. Same story with the first dog, and it didn\u2019t matter, because tissue death can happen so quickly with a severe torsion. \n\nProphylactic gastropexy (tacking the stomach to the abdominal walls) does exist, but was a big-deal open surgery several years ago. I\u2019ve read it\u2019s beginning to be performed laparoscopically now\u2026 but it\u2019s still major surgery, with major recovery and complication potential. It\u2019s also expensive and specialized."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why does the gum tissue regenerate in the soft palate but not around the teeth?", "human_answer": "I mean.... define infection. Infected gums are so common and so easy to achieve that people basically have a low grade infection in their mouth basically all of the time. Overgrown braces can trap bacteria and lead to cavities and decalcifications and I've seen numerous braces taken off to prevent dozens of fillings. But gum health and braces is different I think. I think the primary reason you don't see more severe periodontal issues or severe gum issues is because the population that has braces is usually teens and teens have crazy immune systems. You \"normally\" don't see gum issues in teens because their immune system is so strong and is able to combat the bacteria easily and quickly without damaging surrounding tissues. When they reach their early to mid 20s, you start to see real gum problems and loss of bone around the tooth. I would expect someone with late in life braces that are overgrown to have significant damage.\n\n\nBasically young people have overactive immune systems that prevent real damage but as they age the immune system slows down and the damage builds up. That's why creating good habits is important in kids because they have time to mess it up before it becomes critical."}

{"question": "ELI5: If the germ theory is relatively new, how do they think fermentation was happening (like wine, ale, yogurt etc.) thousands of years ago?", "human_answer": "They just knew that brew begat brew, or they figured it was magic.\n\nThe Norse had a tradition where they would take a piece of wood and inoculate it with the yeast- sometimes a stick they would stir the brew with, sometimes an unworked log they would simply dump in it wholesale. The porous wood would take in living yeast from the brew, dry it safely, and store it for when it was dunked into the next brew.\n\nThey didn't know anything about germs or yeast, they just knew the wood helped the brew.\n\nA lot of medieval European cultures used beer wort to leaven bread. It's easy enough to imagine this originating with someone doing this by accident trying to make a simple flatbread, substituting water for whatever leftover beer they had in the bottom of their pot.\n\nThings can often simply ferment naturally. A fruit laying on the forest floor or a bees nest washed by the rain into a hollow stump have a decent, although not great, chance of being colonized primarily by yeast before anything else. If someone was desperate enough to eat or drink those things, they might put together that letting sweet things sit for long enough sometimes made you feel nice when you consumed them instead of making you sick."}

How did I go my whole life (mid-60s) without knowing this\u203d I had to google your wild claim that couldn't possibly be true. It IS true!\n\n>Red, or dark meat is made up of muscles with fibers that are called slow-twitch. These muscles are used for extended periods of activity, such as standing or walking, and need a consistent energy source. The protein myoglobin stores oxygen in muscle cells, which use oxygen to extract the energy needed for constant activity. Myoglobin is a richly pigmented protein. The more myoglobin there is in the cells, the redder, or darker, the meat.\n\n>White meat is made up of muscles with fibers that are called fast-twitch. Fast-twitch muscles are used for quick bursts of activity, such as fleeing from danger. These muscles get energy from glycogen, which is also stored in the muscles.\n\n>Cows and pigs are both sources of dark meat, though pig is often called \"the other white meat.\" Pigs' muscles do contain myoglobin, but the concentration is not as heavy as it is in beef.

{"question": "ELI5: Difference between a heart attack, cardiac arrest, and stroke?", "human_answer": "A cardiac arrest is any condition where your heart is not pumping blood. There are lots of kinds, but they all result in death without treatment. The most common and treatable kind is because of a heart attack (it stops beating because the muscle has run out of energy or simply died off), but even under the best circumstances the survival rate is \\*only\\* 80%-ish (specifically, if it's witnessed by a paramedic). Across all of them, around 90% or more of cardiac arrest victims die.\n\nA heart attack is an event that injures the heart. The most common one by far involves a blood vessel that supplies the heart being blocked by a clot or by a 'plaque' (fatty stuff on the vessel walls), but there are other types as well, like one that happens because of another serious illness. Heart attack is the single most common cause of cardiac arrest.\n\nA stroke is essentially a heart attack of the brain. They're most commonly caused by a fat or clot blockage of a blood vessel, but occasionally also happen when a vessel tears and the person bleeds into their skull. This kills brain cells, which can leave permanent problems like being unable to move or speak normally.\n\nEdit: kind of a random downvote, don\u2019t you think?"}
{"question": "ELI5: Why does a carton of heavy cream last for 2 months in the refrigerator, but a carton of milk only lasts for about 1 week before expiration?", "human_answer": "Depends son if the heavy cream has stabilizer in it or not. With out any stabilizer the cream would end up lasting a week past it's code date, so right around 30days before notable flavor and odor change. Most milk you get from the store will usually last only 2 weeks because it has been sitting in storage for a while, because stock rotation, you get rid of old before new. Someone else here mentions UHT or ultra pasteurization which can be useful, for non-dairy based milk, because of the caramelization of the milk sugar, to put it simply. Most dairy's here in the states utilize a HTST system, which is high heat short time,which stabilize thebmilk to last around 20 days or up to 27 days. Cream follows the same rules as milk. The biggest cause of milk going bad earlier is because of a few factors, stabilizer in the cream to help it last longer, a piece of equipment was not cleaned as well as it should have been, or most common the raw milk before pasteurization had a high P.I count/tested positive for ropy, which makes the protein in the milk bond in a pretty cool way and it pours out like string. Really cool to see, will make you VERY, VERY sick if you consume it. \n\nSource: I'm a dairy lab technician."}
{"question": "Eli5 Why we cannot build a sleep surplus?", "human_answer": "The body needs sleep to recover from daily activity. It helps with forming long term memory and processing information that was taken in during the day. It also acts as a major source of healing, as the body shuts down active operations and can focus its energy on repairing the body. \n\nWe can become deprived of sleep when we don't allow our bodies enough time to do all the things it needs to do during sleep. We can't develop a surplus because the body can't pre-recover from injury or pre-process data it hasn't received. Sleep is not a resource in the same way that a storage tank of water would be. \n\nImagine that your body is a brick wall, and throughout the day your brick wall becomes cracked and damaged or even needs to grow a little bigger. Sleep is the mason, who spends all night repairing that wall and making it bigger when needed. Sleep deficit would be not giving the mason enough time to complete the repair of the wall, so every day the wall gets worse and worse until you can give the mason enough time to repair. \n\nNow think of the idea of the surplus as the mason having a lot of extra time to do his work. After a certain point, there is nothing left for him to do, so the surplus time is wasted."}
{"question": "ELI5: when we get stressed, and have adrenaline and cortisol run through our system, once we calm down where do those hormones go?", "human_answer": "Systemic chemicals and hormones are mostly broken down in the liver.\n\nIn addition, individual cells of many types can further process many steroid hormones - so cortisol (which is a steroid hormone = basically a fat based hormone) can be further metabolized in neurons to make a neuroactive version that does not affect gene transcription (making proteins) but membrane receptors.  Particularly an inhibitory one called GABA receptors, which also helps \u201ccalm down\u201d activity.  These work in  manner very similar to barbiturate and benzodiazepines and are in fact currently manufactured as anti seizure meds, among other things.\n\nAdrenaline is a no steroid hormone, cant get into cells and so binds to some receptor on the outside of cells, briefly, and then unbinds and is broken down.\n\nCortisol is more complicated - it can get into cells, it can be further processed or metabolized in cells, and these metabolites may also be active.\n\nIn addition there is activation of the opposing neural system (sympathetic and parasympathetic ) which will actively antagonize the effects of the hormones - decreasing heart rate for example.\n\nSo there are many homeostatic mechanisms that restore the resting functions after a stressor."}
{"question": "ELI5: What\u2019s the difference between breathing in through your nose and mouth?

It only hit me that this was I was odd during Covid when people were wearing masks with their nose out. I didn\u2019t get how that made breathing easier.\n\nFast forward 12 months and got a cheap pulse oximeter when I had Covid and a few weeks later had the bright idea to challenge myself to nose breath for 5 mins to see what it did to my oxygen levels. This was going to be the proof that something was wrong with my nose to take to an ENT. I hadn\u2019t bothered seeing one until that point since I knew I didn\u2019t want surgery but I was reconsidering that stance.\n\nFor me, the answer was nose breathing did absolutely nothing to my oxygen levels. The \u2018not-enough air\u2019 sensation was a weird habit. That was about six months ago and with conscious switching to nose breathing every time I catch myself mouth breathing I think I nose breathe about 60% of the time now and climbing.

{"question": "Eli5: How do bones and other organs know what shapes to grown into?", "human_answer": "This topic may be too complicated for ELI5.  There are a lot of genes that produce growth factors, and many of these genes are expressed only at specific times and in specific places.  The location and timing are controlled by other genes making other transcription factors or inhibitors or whatever, also at very specific times and places.\n\nSometimes growth depends not just on a growth factor being produced somewhere, but on that factor diffusing outward through nearby tissues, producing a concentration gradient.  The gradient gives a sense of direction to the tissue growth.\n\nSometimes the shapes of growing organs are affected by the shapes of everything growing around them.  Sometimes the growth of one tissue layer is faster than another, which causes them both to fold or bulge or take other shapes.  Sometimes even the stretching and straining of tissues being pulled around by other growing parts triggers these tissues to make their own growth factors.\n\nThis is tangential to your question, but sometimes the shape doesn't even come from growing, it comes from dying.  Fingers work that way - your hand starts developing almost as a flipper, and the cells in between where your fingers should be undergo programmed cell death."}
{"question": "ELI5 Why do you start laughing when you hear or see something funny?", "human_answer": "My understanding is that the best hypothesis among neuroscientists right now is that laughter is an extension of an early primate's \"all clear\" signal. The idea is that you see or hear something that seems like it might indicate danger, but then you identify the source as something that is actually silly and innocuous. You make a noise, both to release the tension of the situation and to indicate to your fellow primates that there is no actual danger here. In other words, \"Ha ha! For a second I thought that vine was a snake.\"\n\nMost jokes in some way hinge upon this mechanic. The setup builds up some kind of tension, and then the punchline reveals the source of the tension to actually be something silly rather than serious.\n\nIt's also theorized that this may have something to do with the reason why we laugh when we're tickled. Tickling is the rough equivalent of the \"play-fighting\" instinct in cats and dogs--someone reaches out and grabs you in a manner that seems threatening, and weak spots (like your armpits, neck, and belly) are the ones that elicit the strongest response. The person being tickled laughs, as a way of indicating to onlookers \"Don't worry, this is not actually a threatening situation! We're just playing!\""}
{"question": "ELI5: When humans/animals are born they go from not breathing to breathing with their first gasp of air. Why is this a one way process and why can't we go back to non breathing as in a womb/egg?", "human_answer": "We have a machine called ECMO, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, that does this. In ELI5, it exposes your blood to oxygen outside of the body allowing your blood to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide without the need of your lungs.  \n\n\nIt is used in very pre-mature babies who were not in development long enough to have fully formed lungs. While in the womb, our lungs are filled with fluids, and the pressure from those fluids help build all the structures in the lung.  \n\n\nIt is also used in very sick patients who have very severe lung infections. When the lungs are superinfected, they can start leaking fluids into the air chambers, these fluids prevent air from being able to exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide, and so ECMO is used until the fluids can be cleared.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd lastly, they are gels/fluids that we can super-oxygenate and fill our lungs with will actually allow for us to \"breathe\" without air for short periods of time. The problem is cycling the fluids in and out, as well as the ability exchange carbon-dioxide efficiently. It's thought if we can improve this process, that it would be really effective for deepsea diving as it would help offset the pressure issues of deep water and their effect on the lungs."}
{"question": "Eli5: Where do insects go when temperatures drop below -25C in the winter and isn\u2019t the soil frozen for them to go under?", "human_answer": "Interestingly, the issue with freezing isn\u2019t so much that tissue freezes. Well, we do need to maintain a certain temperature internally for our metabolism to function. \n\nBUT, aside from that pesky metabolism thing, we could survive being frozen. It\u2019s the thawing that\u2019s the problem. Since water expands at it freezes (at the microscopic level, it forms crystals that take up more space than the same mass of water at liquid state), it ruptures our cells. This is why frostbite is so difficult to recover from. It destroys the cells that make up the tissue and it\u2019s nearly impossible for the body to regenerate them. \n\nSo, assuming the lack of metabolism weren\u2019t an issue, theoretically\u2026 maybe I\u2019d say not even theoretically, just conjecturing, someone whose dehydrated ought to have less tissue damage if their body was frozen upon thawing compared to someone who\u2019s well hydrated. But even for someone whose dehydrated to the brink of near death, their body still has enough water in it to be traumatically destroyed by the frozen crystals of water. So it\u2019s be the same fate for both. Not sure if one would freeze faster than the other. But one might be less of a human slushie to clean up afterwards?\n\nBut again, just conjecturing for funsies."}
{"question": "ELI5: if procreating with close relatives causes dangerous mutations and increased risks of disease, how did isolated groups of humans deal with it?", "human_answer": "Procreation with close relatives can increase the risks of genetic mutations and disease because it increases the likelihood of inheriting the same harmful genetic variations from both parents. This is known as inbreeding, and it can lead to a range of health problems and disabilities.\n\nIn isolated groups of humans, such as small populations on isolated islands or in remote communities, inbreeding may have been more common due to the limited gene pool and the lack of genetic diversity. However, these groups have likely developed mechanisms and strategies to mitigate the risks of inbreeding and the associated health problems.\n\nFor example, some isolated populations may have developed cultural norms and rules that discourage or forbid marriage between close relatives, in order to prevent inbreeding and the associated health risks. Other populations may have developed genetic adaptations or evolved mechanisms that protect against the effects of inbreeding, such as increased immunity or resistance to diseases.\n\nOverall, while inbreeding can pose significant health risks, isolated populations of humans have likely developed strategies and mechanisms to mitigate these risks and maintain the health and wellbeing of their communities."}

{"question": "ELI5: When a fruit ripens, it gets sweeter over time. Are the sugars already there for the fruit to get sweeter or how does it gain \"sweetness\" over time?", "human_answer": "Fruit contains long chains of starches. Starches are kind of like potatoes. If you bit into a raw potato or a green banana, it wouldn't taste very sweet. With the right conditions, enzymes \\[chemical scissors\\] cut those long chains of starches into short chains that we call sugars.\n\nSometimes those conditions are just putting the food in your mouth. Your saliva contains enzymes (amylase) designed for this. Early Mesoamerican's would chew corn and spit it out to convert the starch of the corn into sugars that could be fermented.\n\nSometimes, the fruit itself or even OTHER fruit produces a gas named ethylene that causes the fruit to ripen. This is the origin of the expression \"One bad apple spoils the bunch\". As fruit ripens, it produces more ethylene. In close quarters, the ethylene from one bad apple could cause the rest of the apples to ripen, increasing their own ethylene production. \n\nAs an aside, this is also a quick way to ripen fruit that you want to eat. If you have some green bananas, put them in a bag with a tomato. The tomato emits enough ethylene to rapidly ripen the banana. I've seen articles that say the exact opposite - you can ripen a tomato with a banana. I guess it depends on which one is producing more ethylene."}

[This](https://www.cacklehatchery.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/red-jungle-fowl-scaled.jpg) is what wild junglefowl chicks look like. \n\nThe bright yellow colors you are familiar with are the result of artificial selection by humans.  People like domestic animals with unusual colors and often selectively breed for those colors.  This has resulted in  a wide variety of ducks and chickens which differ in color from their wild relatives.  Since the same genetic mechanisms tend to control color in adults and offspring, this changes the color of the chicks, too.  And because they are protected from predators, they don't need to be camouflaged.  \n\nHere's a [chart](https://survivalexicon.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/standard-breeds-chart1.jpg) showing various chicken breeds along with their chicks.

HIV likely spilled over in the 20s, but we only have samples that are HIV positive from the 1950s. It's unlikely we'll find samples closer to the spillover event, and it's practically impossible we'll ever have a sample from the spillover itself.  \n\n\nAnd that's just HIV, a blood-borne disease. Something like COVID is spread through the air, so charting that first victim means operating through multiple points of infection, especially if we're talking about a super-spreader. Not only did the Chinese health system go to shit once COVID hit (thus reducing the possibility of records keeping of initial victims), but the dumb lab-leak theory ended any degree of honest data sharing. So thanks to NYT and a few dumb senators - We're probably never going to know how COVID came to be beyond some certainty that it spilled over from a few animals at the wet market in Wuhan.  \n\n\nEbola is another one.

{"question": "ELI5: What causes our brain to get \u201ctired\u201d and lose focus when thinking hard for extended periods of time like studying or thinking through a difficult concept?", "human_answer": "The build up of adenosine in your brain during your waking hours causes you to feel tired. This is called \"sleep pressure\". Adenosine is a metabolic byproduct. I don't know the finer details, but it may be related to the metabolic use of ATP (adenosine tri-phosphate) by your brain.\n\nCaffeine keeps you awake because caffeine occupies but does not activate the adenosine receptors in your brain, preventing adenosine from fitting those receptors and causing you to feel sleepy. But when the caffeine wears off, all that built up adenosine can then cause a caffeine crash, where you quickly get really tired from the built up adenosine.\n\nWhen you sufficient sleep, your brain clears out the extra adenosine in your blood and resets the whole thing. (For a detailed treatment of this, I recommend the book \"Why We Sleep\" by the sleep researcher Matthew Walker.)\n\nSince adenosine builds up throughout the day due to brain activity, I speculate (and please note, this is just my educated speculation) that when you concentrate really hard on something and do a lot of brain-intensive work, the pace of production of adenosine should increase with that increase in brain activity, and that increase in adenosine concentration in your brain may give you that tired feeling."}

As normal, [there is a good writeup on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium_sulfate_(medical_use\\)).\n\nThey have medical effect, they're on the WHO's List of Essential Medicines, and there are a bunch of medical uses that are clinically approved.\n\nHowever, when it comes to using it in a bath, there are so many variables it isn't really worth funded medical studies.  Individual bodies vary with skin thickness, fat, hydration, and other factors. Body conditions vary from mild muscle fatigue to significant muscle injury. Temperature of the water varies. Concentration of the salts varies.  It isn't a case of *\"it might not have any efficacy\"*, instead it is a case of *\"the muscle-needed chemical and nerve relaxant can be used in your bath, season to taste\"*.\n\nTrying to control all of the factors for studies would be a major undertaking and it wouldn't be very useful. It's known to be a relaxant, a laxative, and helps restore a few essential salts in the body. In serious overdose cases it can relax too much with blood pressure drop and too slow of a heart rate, but that's rare unless you start eating the stuff."}

{"question": "ELI5: If exercising means you strain muscles to grow them, why does straining your back hurt it instead of making it stronger?", "human_answer": ">If you're hurting, you went too far or messed up form.\n\nI think you need to be more clear here. Muscle soreness from the lactic acid buildup post-workout (which usually peaks between 24-48 hours I believe) is usually a pretty good sign. If you're *too* sore to do more activity then you probably went too far, but this kind of pain is a sign that you focused the workout on muscles, no? I've cetainly always associated that soreness as a very good thing, typically it's strongest when I haven't worked out in a long time, but it's not an injury.\n\nThen there is the discomfort of intense activity, sometimes a burning sensation in the lungs, and other feelings that people who rarely or never workout often describe as general \"pain.\"\n\nMost kinds of pain felt *during* a workout are likely to be injuries, and if I'm not mistaken this is because it's damage to ligaments, tendons, joints, or other parts of your structure which aren't as resilient or pliable as muscles. Putting too much strain on these structures is what causes injury and requires healing separately from any kinds of strength or endurance or flexibility gains that can be obtained from exercising muscles and the cardiovascular system.\n\nI think it's important to distinguish between these kinds of feelings."}

{"question": "Eli5 How do trees know when to stop growing?", "human_answer": "The electrostatic forces of water limit the growth of trees. \"The forces of adhesion and cohesion enable water in the xylem to reach the top of a redwood tree 120+ m tall. Atmospheric pressure will support a column of water only 10 m tall, but in small capillaries like xylem vessels, the adhesive forces between water and the capillary wall, plus the cohesive forces acting among water molecules, allow water to rise to great heights. The limit is roughly comparable to the moisture tension in the soil at the wilting point. This moisture tension is about (1.5 MPa) 15 atmospheres \u2014 the equivalent of a water column 150 m (500 ft) tall.\" (IASTATE.EDU, Characteristics of water). Redwoods grow so tall because they compete with each other for nutrients or sunlight. This allows water to flow from a high to low osmotic gradient as the cells begin dividing and the trees grow taller. The roots of redwoods are a distance apart such that their xylems are able to diffuse their water across their plasmolemmas. Another characteristic of redwoods is their cells are more likely to divide than grow. This is probably due to the nature of their xylems and vast underlying root system. Less water availability means less growth. My description following the citation is my personal thoughts."}
{"question": "ELI5 why do we hear \"s\" sounds so well when someone whispers, but other sounds are harder to hear?", "human_answer": "Yes your voice does have that much range. If you want to get really technical all sound waves that aren't sines or cosines can be expressed as a sum of sine and cosine waves. When you're speaking normally or singing there will be a lower frequency which is the \"note\" your voice is producing as well as a technically infinite number of overtones which makes up the infinite sum. We don't hear all of them because our hearing has a max of around 20 kHz (which decreases with age and other factors) and some of the sines or cosines will have essentially zero amplitude.\n\nThe other weird thing is we don't hear frequencies evenly and the uneveness of that hearing is also volume dependent. This is demonstrated by [equal-loudness countours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal-loudness_contour)  where everything on the line we perceive as the same loudness. When things are quiet we still perceive things in the 2 kHz to 6 kHz range as much louder. Old telephones tended to focus in on that range which didn't sound good but we hear it well. It's also where we perceive a lot of enunciation which makes it a good frequency to focus on. That's also why old boom boxes had a loudness button. It would boost very low and very high frequencies which he have trouble hearing at lower volumes."}
{"question": "ELI5: If depth perception works because the brain checks the difference in the position of the object between the two eyes and concludes how far away it is, how can we still see depth when one eye is closed?", "human_answer": "What you're referring to, inferring depth from the disparity between images in the two eyes, is called *stereopsis*. It is only one of many cues that your brain uses to infer depth - albeit a powerful one. [This wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception) has a nice overview. Notice all the things listed under \"Monocular cues\". *Monocular* as in \"requiring only one (*mono*) eye (*oculus*)\". These cues all remain when one eye is closed or disabled. They are also the cues that allow you to interpret 2-D images in three dimensions. Even though you need stereopsis to have the full experience of depth, you can still watch a 2-D movie (or image) without it just looking like a bunch of flat shapes. \n\nFor the same reason, it is possible to get a stronger experience of depth from a 2-D video, by closing one eye and sitting close to the screen (to remove conflicting depth cues from your environment). It doesn't always work because there are often some subtler conflicts in depth information too (e.g. your eye can tell that it is focused a certain distance away on the flat plane of the screen), but especially in scenes with a lot of (camera) motion, the pictorial depth cues can be strong enough to override the conflicts and really make you experience depth."}

{"question": "ELI5 Why does exercise have such a big impact on the brain?", "human_answer": "biologically, exercise causes your brain to release neurotransmitters (most importantly dopamine and endorphins). neurotransmitters basically carry the chemicals that are used to trigger certain feelings, and distributes them throughout your brain.\n\nthat being said, endorphins can physically lower feelings of stress and pain and increase mood and energy. dopamine contributes to feelings of pleasure, reward, and satisfaction. exercise is among the healthiest and most natural ways to trigger the release of these neurotransmitters in your brain.\n\nthere are also a few much more simple ways that it could help clear up negative feelings.\n\nfor one, it feels good to be productive. exercise is productive. when you exercise, you might feel a sense of purpose. and fulfilling that goal gives you an immediate sense of accomplishment for how hard you're working. \n\nit also loosens your muscles that are probably otherwise tense from feelings of anxiety and depression while forcing you to breathe more steadily. this reminds your anxious brain that you are safe.\n\nexercising gives you something healthy to focus on. it can interrupt your rumination and anxious thoughts, and refocus your energy onto something real. i think that's a big reason why its clearing up the brain fog and anxiety for you."}
{"question": "ELI5 Why do we need to rake/bag up leaves? Wont they biodegrade on their own?", "human_answer": "Intro:\n\nTo understand this problem, you really need to go back to the history of lawns. Lawns are typically some type of trimmable, regrowing vegetation that is only allowed to get about 4 - 5 inches tall. Lawns were created way back when because destructive rodents (and snakes) were a huge problem, so those who could afford it had lawns around their cottages, mansions, castles, etc. to keep the rodent population down as much as possible. Weeds and leaves give rodents a lot of cover to hide and raise families in.\n\nChapter 2.\n\nIt was probably not too long after lawns came about that people discovered that a solid layer of decomposing leaves kills grass. If they removed the leaves in the spring, they had bare ground and that allowed weeds to move in quickly. So, in the fall they removed the leaves so that the ground cover (grass, ivy, etc.) would continue to stay alive without re-seeding.\n\nPart III\n\nCertain thin leaves (soft maples, willows, beech) decompose quickly and can be easily mulched up with a mower and left in place with very little problem. However, other leaves (primarily oak, holly or magnolia for instance) are quite thick and normally take 2 - 3 years to decompose, even if mulched in a mower. It's really advisable to rake them up as long as you want a nice thick lawn."}

Pick a historical figure from wherever your ancestors lived and there's a good chance you're related to them. \n\nEvery generation back you go, the number of ancestors you have doubles. You have 2 parents, 4 grandparents, 8 great grandparents, 16 great grandparents. Clearly the further back in time you look, the larger your pool of ancestors is. You only need to go back 20 generations until you've got a million ancestors.\n\nAt the same time, the world population was much smaller. Back when Genghis was around, [the world population was less than half a billion.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_historical_world_population) Now we're getting close to 8 billion. Clearly al lot of us are going to be sharing a lot of ancestors when you look back to the 13th century.\n\nThere's a point in history called the[Identical Ancestors Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_ancestors_point), where anyone from that time who has surviving descendents is an ancestor of everyone alive.\n\nGenghis isn't that far back, but it demonstrates the point that he's not actually that special."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why is it healthy to strain your heart through exercise, but unhealthy to strain it through stress, caffeine, nicotine etc? What is the difference between these kinds of cardiac strain?", "human_answer": "Theres many ways you can strain your heart:\n- natural exercise. Exercises usually start from something easy and stretches. For example a lot of people i know walk on the spot for a moment. This causes your heart to gradually increase its rate, and the rest of the body also adapts. Most notable immediate effect: your blood vessels increase a bit in diameter to allow more bloodflow. Doing this over and over with spaces in between makes it clear for your body it needs to buildup muscles, and so your heart gradually grows stronger (along with the other muscles ofc)\n- immediate stress. I cant think of a better term rn. What i mean for example is panic. Things like this have the same effect on your heartrate, but you didnt have that warmup face, so your heart pumps harder but the arteries didnt adept yet. This usually isnt too big of a problem, since its only a temporary situation, but can cause heart failure.\n- drugs: im not sure about nicotine and caffeine in particular, but the problem is usually that they increase the heartrate while at the same time decreasing the diameter of the blood vessels, causing an increase in blood pressure and strains your heart. The heart didnt have any time to adapt to the new stress, and if you have a particularly weak heart it could fail from the pressure"}
{"question": "ELI5: If Neanderthals were a separate species, why were humans able to make fertile babies with them?", "human_answer": "\"Species\" doesn't exist as an objective category in nature. Rather, it's a categorization that was invented by humans, and while it's certainly a very useful concept, it's a complicated one that has dozens of different definitions. It is ultimately arbitrary when we define a new species, and what 'species' means exactly for field biologists might be different for paleontologists. \n\nFor example, if, today, we discovered fossilized chihuahua skeletons and fossilized great Dane skeletons, those might end up getting described as different species. We know today that all dogs are the same species because we can see that they can interbreed, and know that they diverged from one another basically yesterday in geologic terms. But for such differences to arise through natural selection, the two populations would have to be distinct from one another for many thousands of years or more.\n\nSo neanderthals are considered to have been a different species (or subspecies) from modern humans because of the clear morphological differences, and because we know that they diverged from what would become modern humans hundreds of thousands of years before they went extinct. But the labeling is all sort of arbitrary. It's a categorization made up by humans to better understand these differences, nothing more."}

At least that\u2019s the info I was taught to believe. \n\nCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong since it\u2019s been a while since I refreshed on this topic (besides a very brief article skim) but basically the reason why as babies we\u2019re born with fewer instincts than most other animals is because apparently infants cannot be born with the size adults have, so they compensate for it after being born. It\u2019s very different to how other animals are born, where they learn less from their development stages and more from their genes. \n\nBecause of this, they have no clue how the world works.

{"question": "Eli5: Why do very salty foods dehydrate you but drinks like Pedialyte and Gatorade, which have a lot of sodium, rehydrate you?", "human_answer": "There are very few instances where you actually need pedialyte and gatorade.  \n\nOne of them is if you are running a marathon or ultra marathon or any other long physical activity, and you are sweating a lot, and drinking pure water to replace the water lost in sweat.  You can actually get to a point where you have too little sodium in your system.  You can get a condition known as \"Water Intoxication\" or hyponatremia, where you actually can disrupt brain function by having too low of electrolyte levels.  In that case, you'd want a drink like Gatorade to replace electrolytes.\n\nIt's pretty rare, but it has happened.  It's also happened to people who did the stupid (don't try this, really) challenge of trying to drink a 5 Gallon Water Jug in a set amount of time.  By drinking pure water, and going to the bathroom a lot, you can also lower your electrolyte levels too low and get water intoxication.\n\nSo, TLDR, you can put yourselves through activities where you need a fluid like Gatorade, but it would likely be a really extreme challenge in the sun where you are sweating quite a bit and if you replaced all your fluids with water, your electrolytes might get low.  Generally though, even with marathons, they recommend that you either alternate water and gatorade, or have 2 waters for every gatorade."}
{"question": "ELI5: Can a person feel pain or other sensations in a transplanted organ?

One of the bigger ones used a flap from my thigh (muscle, arteries and skin) and was transplanted to my scalp to repair the hole left by wide excision.\n\nAt first the transplant is called completely numb, It takes about 6 months to slowly start feeling pressure. After a year or so feelings of hot and cold start appearing as the nerves slowly regrow from the surrounding tissue.\n\nHere\u2019s more interesting info: https://www.thenakedscientists.com/articles/questions/can-nerves-regenerate\n\n> In the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord), if you injure that - as far as we know - it's permanent. The nerve cells may die; or they may not die but they certainly don't reconnect with where they should connect. That stops signals getting through which is why you get problems of paralysis or loss of sensation, depending on where the damage is. That's why a stroke is so disabling.\n\n> In the skin the nerve cells there seem to be able to survive injury. They also seem to be able to re-grow to their targets so they go back to where they connected to in the first place. So if it was a muscle they were supposed to be supplying, they'll reconnect with the muscle. If it was a patch of skin they can branch out and re-supply the skin so you do get sensation back."}

{"question": "ELI5: How did we realise the mind is in the brain?", "human_answer": "The jury is still out. Despite our advancements and accomplishments we know astonishingly little about human consciousness, and how exactly is it that organic chemistry can produce a being that perceives, thinks, dreams and produces unbelievable achievements in every way imaginable.\n\nBut first things first, let's check the language we're using. Whereas the *brain* is a physical organ situated inside the skull, the *mind* is an abstraction. What we call \"the mind\" is actually a set of functions - our capacity to perceive, analyze, dream up and influence reality (there is probably a more comprehensive way to describe it, but I'm shooting from the hip here). My point being that \"the mind\" is a roof term not an observable object.\n\nIt's still a very useful term and I don't want to downplay it in the least, but, almost paradoxically, it only exists inside the mind via language.\n\nNow whether our thoughts and dreams are produced inside our brains and we all make up our own minds (pun intended), or whether the brain is more akin to a receiver-broadcaster that channels the mind, is a matter of opinion, not fact.

Cold means less when your heater's runnin'. These past couple winters working from home have been my first in all my life without regular cold exposure, and I could tell it's having a physiological effect, because my husband noticed I wasn't warm at night the way I was most winters.\n\nAs an aside; we've got the same deal with the snows not piling up the way they're supposed to. It sucks. We can't even hardly ski anymore. I'm watching my culture die a slow, painful death."}
{"question": "ELI5 How does too much adrenaline affect a man\u2019s erection?", "human_answer": "The nervous system is broadly in two parts. The autonomic part is what controls things automatically for you e.g. makes your pupils in your eyes constrict in bright light or causes your blood vessels close to your skin to dilate when you are hot.  \n\nThis autonomic part is in turn divided into two sections. The parasympathetic half usually dominates as it controls things when you are living your normal day to day life. The sympathetic half becomes dominant when your are in times of stress or excitation e.g. your fight or flight response when you are in danger. Some of the chemicals the sympathetic system uses are called catecholamines, which includes adrenaline.\n\nIt is a quirk of the human sexual response that to maintain an erection the parasympathetic system dominates but when it is time for the penis to ejaculate the sympathetic system (with adrenaline) takes over. \n\nAs such, too much adrenaline could make it difficult to maintain an erection as it is the opposite part that should be more active. But given his explanation didn't go into this it is hard to say if he has had this investigated or is making it up. Genuine too much adrenaline production can be life threatening (try googling phaeochromacytoma).\n\nAs an aside, in medical school this is often remembered as Point and Shoot (Parasympathetic and Sympathetic)."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why can\u2019t we burn more or less calories by working our brain when it already uses a fifth of our daily energy usage?", "human_answer": "First off, the math isn't on our side. the brain uses about 20% of your baseline *resting* energy. If I run for an hour, I'll burn 1,000 Cal, which bumps my daily usage by more than 50% and the brain usage won't increase. \n\nIf I could somehow double my brain's energy usage for a full 24 hours - **which I can't** - that would still only be a 20% increase over my normal baseline. If I did it for an hour (how long my run takes), it would be less than a 1% overall increase over baseline - 1/24th of 20%.\n\nAs to *why* I can't increase the brain's energy: it's hardwired into how the brain works. The human brain uses a very consistent amount of energy at all times, about 20 Watts. There are 100 billion neurons in the brain, and if you increase activity (i.e. energy consumption) in one brain region, other regions will decrease their average activity to balance the total energy needed. Even if an activity engages 1 billion neurons, the other 99 billion can easily balance out that increased energy with a very small decrease in average activity.\n\nThe brain operates separately from the rest of the body in many ways. The blood brain barrier stops a lot of what's in our bloodstream from reaching the brain. Blood pressure in the cerebrovascular system is even controlled separately from the rest of your body. It's pretty finely tuned."}
{"question": "eli5: how does it work that for every pound of weight you lose, there is a 4 pound stress reduction in your knees?", "human_answer": "That's not an exact calculation. It depends on what you are doing.\n\nIf you jump up and land down, you are putting force on your knees both launching and landing. The force is measured in Newtons, not pounds because it's a measure of force, not weight. That stress point of force goes up substantially as you gain weight causing much more wear and tear on your connecting tissue and cartilage. \n\nIn rock climbing this is pretty apparent. A standard carabiner is rated to hold 20 kilonewtons of force. A kilonewton is about 224 pounds. Why would you need equipment that can take 4500 pounds of force when the heaviest climbers are probably more like 250 pounds. Well if someone is falling, they will apply many times the amount of force. In fact, climbing ropes are designed to not put more than about 1600 pounds of force on you so as not to injure you. They reduce the force by stretching a little bit so the force is spread out over a period of time. If it was a static line, you might take 10,000 pounds or more force and have your back broken. Because the rope can only apply 1600 pounds of force on you, this force would be nearly doubled (minus friction) when a belayer is holding the other side. So, a carabiner will undergo 3000 pounds of force on a regular basis. This is the energy it takes to reduce your speed from FAST to STOPPED."}

{"question": "ELI5: Why is Centrifugal force \"not real\"? I remember my physics teacher in high school pushing that idea and understanding why back then, but I do not remember now. I also forgot so much about physics in general that a simple ELI5 would be much appreciated!", "human_answer": "most physics is done in \"inertial reference frames\", which basically means from the point of view of someone who's moving at constant speed and not rotating. In an inertial reference frame, if you look at, say, a ball at the end of a rope that someone is spinning in a circle, there is no force moving outwards. The ball is moving exactly the way you'd expect if the only force on it is the tension of the rope, and that's usually exactly how the situation is described.\n\nIt's only when you look at that system from a reference frame that's spinning along with it, for instance from the point of view of the person holding the rope and spinning, that there seems to be a centrifugal force. If they looked to their side at the ball as they spun, they would see the ball staying still in their vision. Since the rope is pulling the ball inward, there must be another force pulling outward to keep the ball \"in place\", and that's called \"centrifugal force\"\n\nSince centrifugal force only really appears if you're doing physics in a strange way (non-inertial reference frame), it's considered a fictitious force. However, spinning reference frames come up often enough that it's still often a useful concept."}
{"question": "ELI5: when accelerating up to relativistic speeds, is any part of the electromagnetic emissions spectrum of distant objects shifted from background into an observable regime? Like deep infrared gets blue shifted or other phenomenon.", "human_answer": "Yes. The whole spectrum blue- or red-shifts, and that can pull colors in wavelengths the eye can't normally see. Blueshift can pull longer wavelengths (infrared, or even microwave or radio for sufficiently intense blueshift) into the visible, and redshift can pull shorter wavelengths (ultraviolet, or even x-rays or gamma rays for sufficiently intense redshift) into the visible.\n\nIn practice, this isn't usually important. Objects you can see with the naked eye are never far enough away for cosmological redshift to matter, and very few objects are moving fast enough for a red/blue shift you could notice with the naked eye. So there aren't really any objects you can see because of this effect that you wouldn't be able to see otherwise.\n\nThere are, however, some objects you *can't* see that you would be able to see without it. In particular, the cosmic microwave background was emitted when the Universe was at a temperature of about 4000 kelvin. That's a bit cooler than the surface of the Sun, so the Universe at the time was bathed in a uniform yellowish glow well within the visible part of the spectrum. But it has now redshifted far out of the visible range into the microwave part of the spectrum."}
{"question": "Eli5: Why is AC current used to power houses instead of DC?", "human_answer": "You can change the voltage of AC power using a hunk of iron and coils of wire\n\nEvery other explanation is skipping around past this core bit, it was *the* deciding factor in the selection of AC over DC.  DC is actually better for transmission but harder to work with\n\nPower lost in transmission is based on the square of the current flowing through the wire but power delivered is the current times the voltage so if you step up the voltage to a high value you don't have to send much current and therefore don't lose much energy in the power lines.\n\nThe ability to step up DC voltages wasn't available until a few decades after we settled on our power grid standards.  Without access to transistors or at least vacuum tubes(though these would be inefficient) the only way to take one DC voltage and change it to a higher/lower one is to hook a motor to a generator and spin it up.  This isn't great for transforming voltages for every home\n\nThese days we are slowly converting some big cross country lines into High Voltage DC (HVDC) lines because AC is actually *less* efficient to send long distance at a given voltage than DC.  There are some losses due to the Alternating part and switching to DC removes these."}
{"question": "Eli5: why are some airplane jet engines under the wings and some on the vertical stabilizer?", "human_answer": "The reason depends on your \"mission\" . Underwing engines let you have bigger more efficient engines. This also make maintenance easier. The down side is you need long landing gear and they could suck stuff in when on the ground. This puts the aircraft body higher off the ground so you need extra stuff to get people and cargo in and out. So if you need your aircraft to be low to the ground or take off from dirt or grass you have to mount your engines up high. This why lot smaller jets have the engines mounted up on the tail. Down side is this also limits how big they can be, but now your aircraft can sit lower to the ground and not need things like a jet-bridge or extra equipment to load cargo.\n\nSomething to note is when you look at aircraft like the older 737 and A320. Boeing wanted to make the 737 as low to the ground as they could wile keeping under wing engines. This is why they have that odd pouch shape. Airbus just keep the landing gear longer. 737 was designed with the idea that could go in airports that might not have the gear to load cargo in to a taller aircraft. Also the newer regional jet tend to have engines back on the tail. same thing they need to be go in to airports with out jet-bridges."}
{"question": "eli5 - when an engine fires in space and creates thrust - was is it pushing against?", "human_answer": "Think of yourself on a boat with no engine. All you have is a bucket of rocks and no paddles. No wind. How are you going to move? Start throwing rocks! The bigger rocks tend to help the most, but you also found that throwing the smaller rocks as fast as possible works to. Eventually you will be out of rocks.\n\nNow imagine a space ship floating in space. How are we going to make it move? Throw something out the back as fast as possible! But what? Well rocks aren't very good because it takes energy to throw them, but what if our rocks were also their own energy source? Like some kind of fuel we could burn with oxygen? Add to it that the oxygen also acts like our rocks because it also has mass. So we need to burn it in a way that accelerates it as fast as possible in a straight line out the back to make us go forward. We use a rocket engine for this because it's designed to do just that. A rocket engine accelerates the particles of fuel and oxidizer out the back by burning it. Burning it creates heat and heat makes it expand so the gases (rocks) want to go somewhere. We then direct these gases using a combustion chamber and bell shaped nozzle so that they go out the back in as straight as a line as possible."}
{"question": "ELI5: Does wind chill only affect living creatures?", "human_answer": "If you took 2 rocks from your house and one was in the wind and the other was protected from it, the rock in the wind would cool down to 10 F faster. That\u2019s what wind chill is, speeding up the rate of heat transfer by moving the air. It\u2019s the same principle as a convection oven (or air fryer). But they would both end up at 10 F eventually. \n\nIf something is wet then the drier the air is the more the wet thing cools off. This can make the wet thing cooler than the surrounding air as it takes heat to evaporate water. This is why your body can maintain a constant temperature even when the air is over 98 F.  It is also true that this affect is greater when the wind is blowing as the water molecules are rapidly moved away allowing more to evaporate faster. \n\nSo back to the rocks, if they were wet they could temporarily get colder than the surrounding air until the rock dried off. (Note: it gets more complicated because you chose 10 F, but imagine you chose 35 F to simplify things by not worrying about freezing.) the amount and rate the water evaporates and causes cooling would also be affected by the wind. \n\nIn any event, moving the air simply affects the rate at which the heat is transferred, not the amount."}
{"question": "Eli5 Why does heat slow down electronics?", "human_answer": "If it does depend on the electronics. CMOS transistors do get a bit slower because of how electrons move in the warmer material. Bipolar on the other hand gets faster. For most other components there is a not significant change. Resistance in wires does increase with temperature and it can have an effect. But this is not something that has a practical effect for almost all consumer products, you need to do extreme CPU overclocking for it to start to be relevant.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe main reason that computers and phones have reduced performance when warm is that the speed is intentionally reduced.  It is not because they can't operate as fast it is to stop them from getting too warm and avoid physical damage.\n\nSo the clock speed is reduced so the temperature in the chip does not get to high. \n\nThe efficiency of a cooling system depends on the temperature difference between the hot and cold object. So the rate of heat leaving a phone or computer is reduced if the surrounding air is warmer. The rate of heat can be removed from the device is often a limiting factor for the performance of the system.\n\nCompare that to if you do physical work a warm vs cool day. You will get too hot a lot faster a warm than a cool day."}
{"question": "ELI5 what happens when you shine a light inside a perfect mirror ball", "human_answer": "The ball gets heavier.\n\nIf you find a way to introduce photons inside a ball of perfect mirrors, like you teleport them in or something, and there's a perfect vacuum inside the ball, they'll bounce around forever.\n\nThat's because the light inside will behave as a gas, called photon gas ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon\\_gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon_gas)) and has pressure, temperature, the whole shebang. The added weight equals the energy of the photons, which will be very little. But its weight will defo increase. I swear I'm not... gaslighting you.\n\nIf you keep teleporting light in it, the temperature and pressure will increase until it reaches the melting point (or the breaking point, whichever first) of the material the ball is made of. Then it'll crack and release the light inside all at once, which should be quite a flash.\n\nSince we're already in wonderland, with the perfect mirrors and perfect vacuum and teleporting light, we could add that the ball never melts and is unbreakable and perfectly insulating.\n\nThen you can keep teleporting light in it, and you'll start noticing it gets noticeably heavier.\n\nYou can't do that indefinitely though. At some point, it'll turn into a black hole."}
{"question": "ELI5 what's a gravity wave", "human_answer": "Gravity waves are just changes in gravitational force due to changes in mass (well location of the mass)\n\nYou can't really increase/decrease the mass of an object, but you can move it around, or maybe jettison a big chunk of it away. So if you take like two black holes orbiting each other very quickly, they move closer and farther from you increasing and decreasing the amount of gravitational force you feel as their distance from you increases and decreases, and that shows up as a wave which can be detected with sensitive enough instruments.\n\nAs for gravitons though gravitons are a particle that falls under the standard model of quantum physics. Curved space  falls under relativity, a completely separate and independent theory. Both explain things well enough one on large scales and one in small scales, but both are not complete theories of everything. And unifying the two, is one of those things physicists as re trying really hard to do.\n\nThe idea with the graviton is that it's behavior when properly described would reproduce the same behavior relativity describes, just the same way that relativity reproduces the same behavior newtons laws do given the right scale and wiggle room for measurement tolerances."}
{"question": "ELI5 I read laser beams get wider, like a few feet wide by the time they hit the moon, Is that a manufacturing limit, or just something about the physics of laser light? Is a perfect laser beam that doesn't get wider possible?", "human_answer": ">Is a perfect laser beam that doesn't get wider possible?\n\nNo, at every interface or slit light \"bends a corner\"; we call this diffraction. A perfectly focused light is limited by the diffraction it experiences, which we call the diffraction limit.\n\nWhy light diffracts can only be explained by wave theory, and you can observe it by splashing water waves through a slit; it's simply how waves \"do\", and yes it can be a pain when building optical systems.\n\nThis same limit applies to all optical systems like microscopes, fiber optics, telescopes, etc., not just lasers. The fundamental thing is: we need to guide light, so we use optical elements, and slits and interfaces will always cause diffraction.\n\nHowever, lasers continue to have a uniquely low divergence, which is why we use them nevertheless.\n\nWe use several numbers to characterize how \"good\" the laser beam is, but they mostly derive from the M^(2) number; if it's 1, then you have a beam so good that if not for the diffraction at the slit, it would not diverge and remain a \"straight beam\" forever (i.e diffraction limited beam). If M^(2) is larger than 1, then it's not ideal, and usually it isn't, we can have perfectly optimal systems with larger values for M2."}
{"question": "Eli5 Why does forward motion allow bicycles to balance on two wheels?", "human_answer": "Folks, the gyroscope effect of the wheels in inconsequential. They have hardly any significant mass.\n\nCase 1: moving bike. You have a huge source of energy: your momentum. By the subtle changes in your forward path you turn this momentum energy into force that corrects your off-centered state. You'll notice that you have to make larger changes in path the slower you go. This is because you have less momentum energy when you go slower. You're turning momentum energy into force that corrects imbalances.\n\nCase 2: Unmoving bike. As above, slower means less energy, means greater course corrections to the convert momentum into force that corrects imbalance. Now that energy is 0. It's like standing on one foot. You can correct by pushing against the ground, right or left, with the edges of your foot. That's not a lot of leverage, compared to to the your height, but a good bike tire is even narrower than your foot. You have no leverage. You cannot produce enough force to correct imbalances.\n\nYou'll notice that people who manage two balance a stationary bike do so by hopping the bike. This gives them the needed force, by pushing against the ground enough to get slightly airborne. They use this force go correct imbalances."}
{"question": "ELI5: We can recreate a 3-dimensional picture on a 2-dimensional surface. Why can\u2019t we visualize a 4-dimensional world in a 3-dimensional area?", "human_answer": "We're able to visualise 3D from a 2D picture because that's literally what we were trained to do from birth: you have one or two 2D pictures from your eyes (depending on whether you closed a eye or not) and your brain is translating that into a 3D object. In particular, our brain uses the shadows and the lighting to help get a better understanding in complex situations.\n\nAnd in fact, we don't fully see 3D objects. When you look at a 2D objects, you see the borders and the inside of the objects. When you look at a 3D object, we only see it's surface and we don't naturally see inside non-transparent 3D objects.\n\nBoth those facts means that representing  a 4D object in 3D is very difficult. \n\n(1) We're not trained to recognize 4D objects. And even less used to see how lighting and shadows work on them.\n\n(2) Since our eyes are still 2D, that means we would be looking at the 2D image of a 3D object representing a 4D hyperobject. Complexity adds up.\n\n(3) Additionally, since we can't see through 3D objects unless they're transparent, we would be missing a lot of information that would be hidden inside this 3D representation. You can circumvent this last issue with transparent objects but it still adds to the complexity."}
{"question": "ELI5 How do wings generate lift when flying upside down?", "human_answer": "> So the whole Bernoulli's law thing (which I'm sure you know about already) predominates for cambered (non-symmetrical) airfoils at low speeds.\n\n> At higher speeds and for uncambered (symmetric) airfoils, lift comes from the airfoil's ability to deflect air downwards.\n\nImportant correction: *all* wings generate lift by deflecting air downwards.  That's literally the only way to fly, according to the law of conservation of momentum.  In some cases this happens in a crude way by just angling the wings and shoving air downwards\\*, and in some cases this happens more subtly, by giving the wings a cambered shape that creates pressure changes that direct air downward behind the wing, but either way, it's just push air down, plane goes up.\n\nThe explanation we give to laypeople is usually the subtle, complicated one involving shape and pressure and Bernoulli's principle, because we think magical effects must have complicated causes, but OP's question shows how that really confuses the issue rather than helping.\n\n\\* Even for a crude flat plate tilted in the airstream, a lot of the lift occurs via pressure effects at the top of the wing rather than ram deflection of air against the bottom, but regardless: air go down, plane go up."}
{"question": "ELI5: Newton's Third Law of Motion", "human_answer": "To properly understand it, you have to eliminate all OTHER forces acting on everything.\n\nIn other words, consider your man pushing an object floating in vacuum, no friction, no gravity, nothing. You can have a space station or something for reference if you want.\n\nAt that moment, when your 200 lbs man pushes the 250 lbs object, they each are pushed in opposite directions with the same force. In fact, the man is going slightly faster, because he weighs less (so the same force results in more speed as balance), so technically he pushes himself off the object, rather than pushing the object (although, again, both move).\n\nWhen you start involving other forces, like friction and air resistance, it gets complicated because they affect each object differently. Your feet interact with the ground more than wheels, flat surfaces interact with air more than edges. It's why you can swim forwards by flapping your arms back and forth in water in specific ways, rather than just bobbing back and forth around the same spot. Because you utilise the different ways drag in water can act on your arms if you move them in different ways. Applying Third Law still works, water goes back, you go forward, but you need to carefully describe the forces."}
{"question": "ELI5 - If gunpowder accelerated bullets can barely travel a few feet underwater and aren\u2019t even really lethal, how the hell does a spear accelerated by goddamn plastic bands kill fish from quite a distance?", "human_answer": "This is a very complicated physics question to answer precisely.\n\nThe basic idea is that damage potential is linked to the amount of energy delivered to the target. For bullets and spears (ie no explosive warhead), this energy is primarily kinetic energy. Kinetic energy is proportional to mass (weight) and velocity squared (v\\^2). Broadly speaking, the faster a projectile is WHEN IT HITS THE TARGET the better.\n\nThe problem is that this kinetic energy is dissipated through drag in any fluid (air or water). Drag is the rate of reduction of kinetic energy per unit of distance travelled. Water has considerably more drag compared to air. At low speeds, drag  is proportional to velocity but at high speeds, drag is more or less proportional to velocity squared. (There is a complicated bit of physics involved - what is considered \"high speed\" in water is much lower than \"high speed\" in air)\n\nAll things considered, in air, relatively low mass, high speed projectiles (ie bullets) are very effective at delivering energy at long ranges. Because of drag, low mass high speed projectiles in water simply lose energy too quickly. In water, a higher mass, lower speed projectiles (eg spears) are more effective at delivering energy to a target."}
{"question": "ELI5: how do self-filling/gravity fed pet water bowls not overflow and spill everywhere?", "human_answer": "I'm not exactly sure how you tried it with a 2-liter, but it would work under the right conditions. \n\nTake a 2-liter bottle, fill it with water. Take a bowl, and fill that with water too. \n\nTake the 2-liter bottle and turn it upside down into the bowl of water with the opening fully submerged. \n\nAfter the initial rush of water that will inevitably splash out while you're tipping it over, the bottle will stop emptying as soon as the opening is fully submerged under water. This is because air will have no way to get back up into the bottle to \"push\" the liquid out.\n\nedit: if you're just trying to turn a 2-liter over and expect the liquid to stay in, that won't work. Atmospheric pressure is strong enough to force air into the bottle, past the liquid. This actually creates a \"breathing\" effect with the plastic bottle. As the liquid drops out, air pressure inside the bottle drops because there's no air replacing the liquid. This causes the walls of the bottle to collapse into itself. Once the inside air pressure drops to a critical level, air pressure on the outside takes over and air forces itself back into the bottle. This makes the walls of the bottle expand again. This continues (with diminishing returns) until the bottle is empty."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why does the air in the vehicle shudder when only one window is down while driving high speeds?", "human_answer": "When you open the window the air rushing by your window creates low pressure.  You can demonstrate this low pressure by getting a piece of paper, grabbing it with two fingers lengthwise and putting it below your mouth.  When you blow across the paper the paper rises.  \nhttps://youtu.be/NBsvzMi9-f8\n\nThe fast moving air above the paper creates low pressure and the paper rises.  This is the same principle with your car window.  The fast moving air outside creates low pressure and pulls air out of the car.\n\nSo it's sucking air out of the car and it eventually lowers the pressure inside of the car below the pressure outside of the car.  I suspect this is due to the momentum of the air.   Once the pressure equalizes the air doesn't suddenly stop but momentum keeps the air moving out until the pressure inside the car is below ambient.\n\nThen the air reverses direction and gets pulled into the car. This happens until the pressure inside the car is greater than the air pressure outside the car and the cycle begins anew.\n\nThe air pressure is trying to find equilibrium and can't.  Your ears don't like this rapid pressure change and you can feel it on your ear drums.\n\nOpening more windows allows the car to reach equilibrium and this goes away."}
{"question": "ELI5: How is an airtight seal possible since the molecules of air are smaller than than the space in the seal itself?", "human_answer": "There are some very good answers here, but I'm going to add a pedantic comment: It absolutely isn't.  Or I should say that in absolute terms it's not.  \n\nThe molecules in air will actually diffuse through most materials (if very very slowly with some), depending on which part you're talking about (nitrogen, oxygen, CO2, other stuff) in a process called \"permeation\" which accounts for sorption into the high concentration side, diffusion through the bulk materials and desorption on the low-concentration side.\n\nThe rate of all this will vary with the surface treatments (which is why potato chip bags are shiny - coated with evaporated aluminum to slow down oxygen that makes the chips stale and soggy), the bulk matrix composition and structure which is why dense materials are needed or if you can't do that (soda bottles) the items are made in a very complex system to stretch their structure \"tight\" and slow down permeation, and species of permeant. Hydrogen, being very small, actually will permeate into and through metals.  Other species will be much slower or (in practical terms) stopped.  Where it gets really weird is when you have a species that interacts with the polymers of the seal to change things, but that's a nap-worthy post on its own."}

Another example is wet sand or mud, as a whole, it does not behave like a classic solid or a classic liquid.\n\n*compressed in the sense that if you give infinite room, the gas will take all the room, and if you change the space it is confined, it will evenly be squeezed in it. Non compressible means that if you try compress the material, it will change its volume by very very little and oppose a lot of resistance to it.\n\nThese categories are broad and used for broad description. There are applications in which you can force these categories of material to do weird things, in extreme circumstances. For example, air at supersonic speed is not compressible, or better, does not behave like a compressible fluid."}
{"question": "ELI5 If light is the fastest thing know to man, how do we know anything we observe is still out there?", "human_answer": "Currently, our models include causality and locality, and this means that inforrmation in reality travels at the speed of light.\nIf the sun were to dissapear suddenly, from the perspective of someone at the position of the sun, it would dissapear \"before\" it did for us here on earth.\n\nUnder EVERY metric we can observe, the sun would be there until its light stopped reaching us. There is no machine that we could place at the sun and have it tell us before it dissapeared for us.\n\nIt is the same with those distant galaxies. Their gravity, their light, their mass, etc. Exists right now as we observe it. We can tell that is all very old, but from our perspective that is all still there, and if it were to dissapear, that would not be part of our reality until it reached us. Since time is relative, the past of those far away things is simultaneous with our present, and vice versa.\n\nThink of light. Things that travel at the speed of light do not experience time while travelling, all of eternity is simultaneous to a photon.\nIf you look at the right place, the radiation from the big bang is simultaneous with our present. We understand, in our linear concept of time, that it happened in the past, but from the perspective of reality, it is still happening."}
{"question": "ELI5: The concept of bootstrap paradox, please", "human_answer": "The bootstrap paradox is a problem in time travel when something (an item, a bit of information, etc.) ends up in a time loop, with no point where it actually originated.\n\nThe classic example: I wake up one day and a time machine has appeared in my room.  Out of the time machine steps an older version of me.  He says \"Here are the instructions for how to build a time machine, have fun!\"\n\nSo I spend the next 10 years building a time machine.  Once it's ready, I hop in, take a trip to 10 years before, wake my younger self up, hand him a copy of the instructions, and say \"Here are the instructions for how to build a time machine, have fun!\"\n\nThe fun part about this is that it creates a time travel loop - how did I know how to create the time machine?  I had the instructions.  And how did I get the instructions?  I made sure to give them to myself.  But the question that comes from that loop is: where did the instructions come from originally?  I only have them because they were given to me, and the guy who gave them to me only had them because they were given to him.... and so on, and so on.  There's no actual origin for the instructions, which is paradoxical.  It's a staple of time travel fiction, despite not making a lot of sense once you get down to it!"}
{"question": "ELI5: Why is it safe to touch the electricity-outputting end of our phone and computer chargers with no sort of electric shock on us as opposed to other dangerous electrical outputs?", "human_answer": "there are several reasons:\n\n- current type: DC (direct current like from a battery or your phone charger) is not as good at delivering an electrical shock as AC (alternating current, like you get from your wall outlet)\n- voltage (like water pressure): lower voltages (like the 5 volts from a traditional phone charger), cannot travel through skin under normal circumstances.  higher voltages are more effective at traveling through more difficult things like dry skin, and even the air.  (current from tesla coils is in the thousands of volts and can shoot several feet through the air)\n\n9 volts DC (like from a 9v battery) is still not enough to shock your skin, but if you touch it to your tongue, you will feel tingles.  so on the other side of things, you have the material electricity needs to travel through.  they all have different levels of resistance.  if they let current pass through easily, they're called conductors.  if they're good at resisting current flow, they're called insulators.  rubber, air, and glass are good insulators of electricity.  metals like copper and aluminum are good conductors of electricity.  dry skin is not, but the wet skin of your tongue is a bit better, and just enough to where you can start to feel a small shock on your tongue"}
{"question": "ELI5: Why is a 100 person choir singing the same song not 100 times louder than one person?", "human_answer": "1. The singers are not synchronized in terms of pitch and arrangement; some people sing faster, some slower, some sing it smaller like \"we are the peoplee\" and some sing it longer like \"we are the peeeeeopleeeee\"\n\n\n2. Each 100 person choir is not pitch perfect; When you sing, you hit notes, although you will never hit them 100% perfect, it's either almost perfect or not at all perfect. Now, in a choir, when 100 people sing, their pitches are not always perfect so they do not collide with each other and this make it sound more \"detuned\" a.k.a more widespread on the hearing stereo field.\n\n\n3. Their volume is not equal; Some people sing louder and some people sing less louder.\n\n\n4. Their vocal characteristics difference; Not everyone have the same voice, it's different voices giving out the same sound, which again doesn't clash with each other and sound more defined in the stereo field.\n\n\nDuring recording choir, if it's a team then the team will do chorus and record it. However, a single person can also do a choir by recording him/herself different takes of the same lyric and arranging them so they don't hit at the same time (hit a few milliseconds later) and panning them on the stereo field.\n\nI hope you can understand this well now, AMA if you have doubts."}
{"question": "Eli5: what is negative g force and why does it make you feel so weird?", "human_answer": "Negative Gs is an acceleration upwards. Right now we are experiencing 1G because we are experiencing the force of gravity. Hanging upside down would feel exactly the same as standing upright and experiencing -1G. Negative Gs feel so weird because you have extra blood rushing to your brain, whereas it normally pools in your feet.\n\nWhen you're on a rollercoaster and you go over a hill and it feels like you are getting lifted out of your seat, that is negative Gs. When you go down into a dip and it feels like you are being pressed into your seat, you are experiencing >1G.\n\nIf you balance it just right, you can experience 0G, like for example the Vomit Comet, a plane used for training astronauts can simulate 0G. Basically the plane flies up and then just shuts off its engines and tries not to glide. The plane wants to act like a projectile in a vacuum. So since you and the plane are both falling at exactly the same speed, you appear to not be affected by gravity relative to the plane, and this continues until the plane starts to pull up. This is also why astronauts feel 0G, because it's just a fall that lasts forever. If the plane were to use its engines on the way down, you'd experience negative Gs because the plan would be accelerating down faster than you."}
{"question": "Eli5 How does nuclear fuel get spent so fast?", "human_answer": "They're not the same reactions\n\nNormal decay is random.  A U-235 decays and then nothing else happens, there's no chain reaction\n\nIn nuclear reactors the fuel is refined and set up in the reactor so it'll be critical so each atom that splits causes one other atom to split.  Now you're not waiting for each one to randomly breakdown by instead trigging a chain reaction that works its way through the fuel fairly rapidly splitting the available atoms into smaller ones.  If they need more power from the reactor they briefly adjust the control rods so each split triggers more than one other split to get up to a higher power level then reduce it back to 1-1 to hold at that level.  The more power you need to pull from the reactor the faster you need to burn through the fuel\n\nThey also don't burn through all the fuel of the fuel rod, but it starts building up byproducts that muck with the power you can get out of it so they have to swap it out.  Unfortunately the byproducts are wayyy less stable than the starting uranium/plutonium so now the random decay is occurring at a much faster rate creating a lot more radiation but less useful kinetic energy(heat) from the process.  The really angry byproducts are mostly cleared out after a year because they decay that rapidly"}
{"question": "ELI5: The \"water puddles\" that are visible on concrete in hot weather, but as you drive closer there's nothing there", "human_answer": "The basic simplified version is that air is just like water or glass when interacting with light: it *bends* it. Now for glass and water, that\u2019s a lot of bending, and as a consequence you can see it in pools and glasses and what not! Air bends light as well, but very very little\u2014it\u2019s entirely unnoticeable to the naked eye at close range. However, the amount light bends through air is dependent on the density of that particular pocket of air, and that density is related to environmental factors like temperature and humidity.\n\nNow think about the road on a sunny day. The pavement is going to soak up a lot of heat from the sunlight, and as a consequence, the air right next to the ground is going to get quite hot compared to the rest of the air mass above it, and the boundary between these two layers of different density is chaotic and ripply due to the hot less dense air trying to rise into the cold denser air. This leads to a weird effect where some of the light coming down from the sky very close to the horizon hits the edge of the hot ground layer just right and \u201cbounces\u201d as it bends, coming back up to reach your eyes. The resulting reflection is functionally very similar to that of a pond or puddle, which is why that\u2019s the first thought that pops into your head!"}
{"question": "ELI5: Mass explanation: I\u2019ve always been told that mass was not the same as weight, and that grams are the metric unit of mass. But grams are a measurement of weight, so am I stupid, was it was explained to me wrong, or is science just not make sense?", "human_answer": "There are two distinct notions of mass.\n\n\"Inertial mass\" is a measure of how hard it is to change the current speed of the object. (A lorry has more inertial mass than a car; it's harder to slow it down when it's moving).\n\nThe other notion is \"gravitational mass\" - how hard it is to move an object against gravity. (A lorry has more gravitational mass than a car - it's harder to lift it up).\n\nThe actual effort required to \"lift\" an object with gravitational mass through a particular gravitational field is called \"weight\". (A lorry has more weight on earth than on the moon. It has the same gravitational mass, but the gravity is weaker on the moon so it's easier to lift).\n\nEssentially, gravitational mass is an *intrinsic property of just the object*. Weight is this intrinsic property of the object *combined with the strength of the gravity it's sitting in*.\n\nInterestingly, the numerical value of the inertial and gravitational masses is exactly the same, and we don't really know why. In Einstein's general relativity, their equivalence is taken as a postulate called \"the principle of equivalence\". People have proposed some theories (e.g. string theory) that allow you to derive the equivalence from more fundamental axioms, but we don't know the real answer for sure yet."}
{"question": "ELI5: Is the 4th dimension something that we know actually exists? Or is it just a concept?", "human_answer": "We have three spatial dimensions.\n\nLength, Width, Height.\n\nUsing those three dimensions you can plot a spot in any space.\n\nWe do not know if there are more spatial dimensions, if there are, they are likely to be things we're not capable of observing.\n\nWhat does it even mean to have a 4th spatial dimension, when you can plot any location in space using only three?\n\nThat's beyond the scope of eli5.\n\nWe have a temporal dimension as well.\n\nWe don't know exactly what this temporal dimension *is*.\n\nWe know what it feels like.  It feels like the past moving through the present to the future.\n\nBut Einstein turned that concept on its head when he declared the speed of light is constant.\n\nThat's also beyond the scope of an eli5.\n\nEinstein called this Space-Time and it's the mathematical representation of both space and time as a singular entity, when you pull on one, the other is pushed.  When you push on one the other is pulled.  Space and Time are connected.  \n\nBut we don't know if time is an actual dimension, or if it's just the emergent property of having the ability to move through space while being constrained by the constant nature of the speed of light, which dictates that Space and Time *must* change, and that they change in ways that are correlated to one another."}
{"question": "ELI5 : How does flowing electricity in a closed circuit lead to an LED lighting up?", "human_answer": "Older incandescent lights worked by making part of the circuit a special kind of wire that electrons really don't like to flow through. They scrape and bang and batter as they flow through that part of wire, which creates a kind of electrical friction. That friction heats up the wire so much that it glows, like a campfire cinder. That's why those kinds of bulbs are really hot to the touch, they're less light-making machines as they are heat-making machines that happen to glow as a side effect.\n\nLEDs are trickier to explain correctly. You can imagine an LED like a huge cliff, with a high end and a low end. The power source stuffs electrons onto the high side and pulls them out of the low side, creating a situation where you have a ton of electrons crowded together at the top of the cliff and almost no electrons at the base of the cliff. The electrons don't like being crowded, they'd prefer to be down at the bottom where they can get out of the crowd. Luckily, there's a set of playground slides that will let them slide all the way down. But to ride the slide, they have to pay a toll. The price is 1 photon of light of a certain color. So electrons \"pay up\", release a photon of light, and go down the slide. Those released photons make the LED glow in a specific color."}
{"question": "ELI5: How would putting a blanket over a rope or chain under tension (i.e. pulling a truck out of sand/mud) work to reduce the risk of it flying out and hurting someone should it snap?", "human_answer": "I was wrong to say the direction would be towards the car pulling. It really comes down to the vector math of the situation. Let me explain two possible scenarios:\n\n1. One car is truly stuck, One is pulling. Newtons Third Law takes effect here: Every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Take a shoelace with both ends in either hand. Hold one hand steady and pull with the other. When you let go with the pulling hand it will slingshot back to the steady one. To illustrate with vectors:\\[mass\\]-------> When a snap occurs an opposite vector occurs: \\[mass\\]<-------\n2. Both cars are pulling away from each other with varying forces. Which would then come down to vector subtraction: <----------(L10) vs (R5)-----> == <-----(L5) So if a snap occurred in this scenario it would fling right in opposition at 5units.\n\nTo explicitly answer your question of appearing to be static. Its about exerted force. Kind of like an arrow in a cocked bow. It looks stationary but energy has been placed into the string, as long as the archer is holding the string back or car is straining. Energy is there. It costs the archer energy to exert force to hold the string in place. When the archer finally lets go (or line snaps). The string/line flings back in the opposite direction of the pull."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why does it hurt your ears and make that \"wahwahwahwah\" sound when only one window in a car is down and you're moving fast? And why does it disappear instantly when another window is rolled down?", "human_answer": "It's called buffeting it's common but a car interior can be designed to minimize this effect. It's caused by the air comming in through the window and causing a resonant continuous preasure wave inside the car. Imagine if you will a pond if you throw in a rock in the middle the waves will go out towards the edges but if they are big enough they may bounce back and than go towards to center again. Now if the timing is just right the waves going out and the ones comming in can meet and amplify each other. Then if you keep on throwing in rocks and you time that right you can make the waves even bigger. But if you also start throwing rocks in another spot and time that just right you can cause another wave that will clash with the first one and instead of amplifying it it will be minimizing it's amplitude. \nAir essentially behaves like a liquid it's just transparent and not very dense. We can't see the waves but they are there. Just like an acoustic guitar has a resonance box that amplifies it's sound, the cars interior can act like a resonance box with it's dimensions determining the exact frequencies that will cause modes: standing waves. Opening another window changes the dimensions again and also adds another source of incoming air pressure wich may cancell out the first one."}
{"question": "ELI5: How can we be confident about universal properties, or anything for that matter, in astrophysics when we can\u2019t actually do experiments on stars, distant planets, etc. ?", "human_answer": "We can\u2019t, and that makes astronomers just slightly nervous all of the time. It\u2019s a conscious *assumption* of astronomy that any given place in the Universe is broadly similar to any other place in the Universe, and this assumption has been very helpful in piecing together a picture of what\u2019s going on elsewhere. It seems consistent enough to be reliable. But if any evidence ever came out that this wasn\u2019t the case we\u2019d have to rethink everything we know about the Universe.\n\nEnter the **Axis of Evil.**\n\nThis is a peculiar observation about the Cosmic Microwave Background.

It\u2019s *probably* just a quirk of our measurements or something but no one\u2019s ever been able to conclusively explain it. And, absent a solid explanation, it lurks on the periphery of all astronomy and threatens to upend the whole apple cart."}
{"question": "Eli5: the differences between decibels (dB) and weighted decibels (dBA)", "human_answer": "The ear response to sound pressure waves is different for various frequency.\n\nThere exists lookup tables to convert actual sound pressure in dB to more relevant perceived sound pressure in dBa.\n\n[https://www.nexflow.com/blog/what-does-dba-mean/](https://www.nexflow.com/blog/what-does-dba-mean/)\n\n>A dB(A) measurement has been adjusted to consider the varying sensitivity of the human ear to different frequencies of sound.

{"question": "ELI5 : Why does closing a door make music from the other room quieter, even though sound travels better through solid objects?", "human_answer": "When sound changes medium part of it is reflected, in simple terms. You've closed a door: the noise you generate needs to migrate from the air of the room into the door, then back into the air where your ear/mic is. A lot of energy is being wasted.\n\nMaterials can be characterized according to something called \"acoustic impedance\", basically how the material reacts to soundwaves. When passing between two mediums, the fraction of sound energy that actually transfers between mediums (as opposed to bouncing) increases as the difference in acoustic impedance becomes smaller.\n\nMetal and water? Sound passes very easily from one medium to the next, making it easy to hear the clanging of a pool ladder when underwater. Air and water? The relative difference in impedance is large enough that you'll struggle to hear much of anything happening above the surface when underwater.\n\nEver had an ultrasound? If yes you've probably noticed that the technician or doctor operating the thing applies some sort of gel to your body. This acts as an intermediary between your body and the machine, allowing more sound to pass through when it otherwise would mostly just bounce away.\n\nSound can pass quite easily though a wooden door. However, closing a door means you're allowing the soundwaves to be reflected away from you."}
{"question": "ELI5 Why are red stars red, despite being hotter than a blue flame?", "human_answer": "Ok, first the AKHTUAHLY out of the way:\n\nIt still won't reach that temperature as diamond, because it decomposes into graphite at about 1500 C.\n\nBut to actually answer the question you are asking, to the best of my understanding:\n\nEverything emits as much light as it can absorb. Emissivity = absorption. That's why black body radiation refers to perfect black bodies. Perfect absorption, perfect emission.\n\nSo diamond should emit the correct range of thermal radiation, but what matters here is the amount. It's nearly perfectly transparent to visible light, so it will emit a nearly unnoticeable amount of it. It remains this clear up to a very high temperature, until it decomposes.\n\nSo as far as I understand, you might see it glow faintly in a dark room, or detect the light with a sufficiently sensitive sensor. But it will effectively look transparent up until it decomposes into graphite.\n\nTo compare that to your original question, about stars:\n\nStars are made of plasma. And plasma is basically as close to a perfect black body as ee can get, it absorbs all light almost perfectly, therefore it emits black body radiation nearly perfectly. There's deviations in the form of absorption and emission lines, so composition matters, but stars broadly follow the colour distribution of the black body spectrum."}
{"question": "ELI5: If light doesn\u2019t experience time, how does it have a limited speed?", "human_answer": "It\u2019s just something that\u2019s baked into the universe itself. Like the current top comment says, it would be better if we actually referred to the speed of light as the speed of causality. Light is just the top racer who is stuck at that speed limit.\n\nAs for it being baked into the universe, it\u2019s a bit like asking why if you walk in a straight line on a sphere, you end up where you started. That\u2019s a feature of living on a sphere. The speed of causality is a feature of living in our universe.\n\nAs to why this speed is what it is, that has to do with the complex shape of the universe, similar to how the diameter of the sphere will determine how long it\u2019ll take you to get back where you started on your trip across the surface of the sphere.\n\nThe time part of OP\u2019s question is stuck in some confusion about the unitary nature of space-time and the mathematical singularity of infinity. Easier to say that to \u2018experience\u2019 time requires a conscious observer for the question to make any sense. That in turn will take you to Einstein\u2019s wonky thought experiments with time dilated observers.

{"question": "ELI5 Usually planes are able to fly when air moves across the wings which generates lift. But how do fighter jets able to maintain lift while performing aerobatic maneuvers?", "human_answer": "There are a lot of misconceptions about lift. One big one is how significant the Bernoulli effect is on lift, this is the common explanation of \"air moves over the wings which generates lift.\" The more important component to lift is the simple act of air hitting the wing at a slight angle, air bounces down, Newton's third law pushes the plane up.\n\n\nAs long as your plane is slightly angled against the direction of your motion/the air around you, then the plane will have a force on it. Sometimes this is the whole wing, sometimes this is just an aileron. \n\nAnd sometimes you don't even need lift. As long as there's a good mile between you and the ground, its ok to \"fall\" for a little while before bringing your aircraft back to a position where it generates lift. And if you can create enough vertical speed, you also buy yourself a little more time before you need lift. A loop involves turning your plane up to convert all your horizontal speed to vertical speed by means of lift due to higher angle of attack. That vertical speed can get you pretty high before gravity starts calling again. \n\nLastly, those engines on fighter jets are powerful, sometimes they have a bigger thrust to mass ratio which means they alone can provide enough force to fight gravity. Though you don't necessarily need strong engines to do acrobatics."}

{"question": "ELI5 : Why do they say the area around the sun is hotter than the surface itself, it doesn't make any sense.", "human_answer": "Why do they \"say\" it's hotter than the surface?\n\nBecause all measurements of temperature show that it is far hotter than the 'surface' layer.

It doesn't need to 'make sense' for it is a measured, observable fact.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat phrasing aside, you have identified a currently unsettled question in Astronomy.

That's how the rest of the sun seems to work, so it is a very big puzzle.\n\nBut the sparse plasma of the corona behaves a bit differently than the rest of the sun.  Magnetic fields are more free to move through it for example, compared to the dense solar 'surface'.\n\nSo waves in the magnetic field is one model they're working with.\n\nAnother is interactions with solar flares, or even 'nano-flares' that serve as a way to introduce heat into the corona and crank the temperature up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat said, the total energy in the hot corona is still far far lower than the energy in the surface of the sun, so we're still obeying conservation laws."}
{"question": "ELI5: How does a machine \u201cmake something cold\u201d", "human_answer": "So refrigeration works by moving heat from inside to outside the unit and it does this by changing states of the refrigerant.\n\nWhen something goes from a gas to a liquid it dumps a ton of its heat energy and the opposite happens when it goes from liquid to a gas by absorbing heat.\n\nThe machine causes the refrigerant to change states at specific places by changing the pressures since pressure changes the temperature the material changes states at(things at lower pressures will boil at lower temperatures and vice versa)\n\nSo you take your refrigerant in a gas atate and run it through a compressor, you then run it through a condenser which is outside the unit and the refrigerant condenses to a liquid and dumps a ton of its heat away(remember this is outside the box you want to be cooled). You then run the liquid refrigerant inside the box and inside is an expansion valve which lowers the pressure of the refrigerant and goes immediately into the evaporator. When the pressure lowers the refrigerant boils and turns to a gas again which absorbes a ton of heat, heat that was inside the box. The refrigerant now travels back outside to the compressor and goes through the cycle again.\n\nThat is how it moves heat from inside the box to the outside, by forcing it to change states in specific places which absorbes or dissipates a ton of heat."}
{"question": "ELI5: Which transmission gives more mileage and why?", "human_answer": "For 95% of people and 95% of driving, a modern automatic is the right choice. \n\nIn the old days, there was about a 10% loss of mileage with a three-speed torque converter automatic. Modern autos have more gears, torque converter lockup and presumably other efficiencies that reduce this difference significantly. \n\nThey also work much better with all of the modern technologies in todays cars. \n\nIf you are looking at a simple, light sports car or hot hatch which is driven mainly for pleasure - that\u2019s when I would consider a manual. It does give more engagement - it\u2019s simply more fun. \n\nThe modern thing is a very complicated device called a twin-clutch automated manual gearbox; called DSG in Audi, PDK in Porsche, with other manufacturers having their own names. Unlike regular automatics, they are both faster and more economical than manual transmissions. But much more complicated and with the risk of expensive repairs. Look for a long warranty. \n\nCVT transmissions are different altogether, quite efficient, not hugely complicated, generally boring as fuck to drive. \n\nIf you know what brand of car you are looking at, people can give more informed recommendations based on what that manufacturer does well. If you don\u2019t care that much about the brand, then I would just say get whatever is the most popular fitment for the model you choose."}

Schmidt, however, is an expert on sprays: shower sprays, fuel injector sprays, that kind of thing. A fluid is forced out of a small opening and thrust into the unpredictable world, and it's David Schmidt's job to somehow predict it.\n\n> \"I realized that they were all weighing in with their opinions,\" he said, \"and with these computer simulations I was doing\" -- for his serious research -- \"I had something at my fingertips that I could use to answer it.\"\n\n> After two weeks of number crunching using a spray simulator that only he has, Schmidt discovered the answer.

{"question": "Eli5: Does all sound travel at exactly the speed of sound? If so why?", "human_answer": "Sound travels at a certain speed because that's how fast air molecules bump into each other to keep the chain reaction going. Imagine air molecules are a bunch of beach balls floating around in a large room. Then suddenly move one of the walls of the room inwards. The wall will smack into a bunch of the beach balls, and those balls will smack into more balls, etc. You'll see a \"wave\" propagate through the beach balls. The speed of that wave is the speed of sound. \n\nIn fact, sound travels at a lot of different speeds. It travels at a slightly different speed when you get higher in altitude (because air pressure decreases), and it travels at a slightly different speed when the weather is hot vs when it's cold, or humid vs dry. The \"official\" speed of sound is just the speed at sea level at a certain temperature and humidity, but otherwise the speed varies with changes in temperature, pressure, humidity, and other variables. \n\nAlso, sound travels different speeds in different mediums. For instance, it travels waaaay faster in water than in air, and even faster through solid objects.\n\nThe volume of a sound has nothing to do with it's speed. Volume is more about how large of a change in air pressure is created by the sound. If it creates a bigger change in air pressure, it's louder. But otherwise, the sound propagates at the same speed."}
{"question": "ELI5: Would air conditioners be more efficient in shade? Why does it always seem like they are placed up on roofs or in the open sun?", "human_answer": "The US building code does not allow for air-conditioners to hang out of windows and such. If you look at photos of Hong Kong or other East Asian cities where they just put air conditioners anywhere, they don't want that here stateside.\n\nThe reason why they put an air conditioner on the roof is that there is no where else to put it. And the most efficient space is on the roof. They also don't want people seeing the mechanical units from the street, so often they will require us to put up a roof screen.\n\nAir conditioners for a SFH will often have the units located to the side of the house. This is because that is the most efficient (easiest) place to locate them. They don't locate them in front of the house and they try not to locate them in the back of the house. This is because people tend to use the front and back yards. And you don't want noisy air conditioners ruining your backyard/frontyard parties.\n\nSo this is why they locate them off to the side of the home. Or in a commercial residential/office property, they will locate these bad boys on the roof.\n\nThey always locate them outside. Doesn't matter the outside conditions, when they pick your air conditioner unit, they will have accommodated for the outside temperatures already. \n\nThis is how they have air conditioners for those living in the dessert. Such as Las Vegas or Saudi Arabia."}
{"question": "ELI5: How exactly do pulleys create mechanical advantage?", "human_answer": "One fixed pulley only changes the direction of force. So you can lift something up by pulling down or to the side on a rope. Multiple fixed pulleys do the same thing, just let you customize the angle more. You could set up a complicated set of pulleys and sit on your couch to lift your neighbors couch in their house. No change in mechanical advantage, just complicated.\n\nIts when you start adding pulleys that aren't fixed - either attached to the mobile object, or attached to the length of rope itself.\n\nImagine a box at the bottom of a pit: if you attach a rope to it and pull, you're lifting the full weight as if your hand were directly on it. \n\nNow, tie the rope to the tree next to you, and down to the box with a pulley attached (could just be a handle on the box for this), then back up to you. When you pull the rope up two feet, the box only comes up one foot, because the rope is sliding through the pulley; you're shortening the rope between you and the box, but also between the tree and the box, but the tree isn't pulling, its just sitting there. But half the weight of the box is supported by the tree, and half by you. So you have to pull the rope twice as far to get the box out, but the apparent weight you are lifting is only half of the box.\n\nThe proper configuration of pulleys can amplify that: pull less weight by pulling the rope farther."}
{"question": "eli5: What is the bootstrap Paradox?", "human_answer": "It's from a Robert A. Heinlein story called [\"By His Bootstraps.\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/By_His_Bootstraps) There's a college student trying to write an essay and his future self appears and explains that he shouldn't listen to anything any future selves tells him to do. Then a second future self appears and tells him not to listen to the first future self.\n\nThis adventure begins with a loop. The character appears from the future, telling the present day character not to travel to the future. If you went back in time and told yourself not to go to the future -- and presumably ignored that advice -- why would you again travel into the past to tell yourself not to go?\n\nThe catalyst for you doing the thing you immediately regret is yourself. You create and perpetuate a time travel loop that you don't want to happen.\n\nIn the story the character travels into the future discovers this weird guarded palace and is trying to track down the owner of the palace (for a reason I don't recall). Eventually we learn that >!all of the characters were the same character at different stages in the future.!<\n\nTL;DR: If you are wearing a pair of Doc Martens with the little loop in the back, you cannot pull on them and lift yourself up. The bootstrap paradox examines how time travel can create impossible situations when a character interacts with themselves."}
{"question": "ELI5: What makes eggs such a magical ingredient for baking?", "human_answer": "Molecules for the most part can either be polar or non polar. Polar molecules are really good at mixing with polar molecules, and non polar molecules are really good at mixing with non polar molecules. Polar means there's a positively charged side and a negatively charged side, whereas non polar has relatively uniform charge.\n\nPolar and non polar don't mix very well, like oil and water. Oil is non polar and water is polar.\n\nEggs contain some of the special molecules that have both a polar and non polar sides, so it acts like a bridge between the polar and non polar molecules in the mix for the baked goods.\n\nThe proteins in the eggs that do this will then change shape when they get heated up (baked) and this is called denaturing. This is why eggs go from liquid to solid when you cook them. The proteins change shape and link together to form a solid. When this happens the baked good mix, it basically ends up making the structure for the baked good. Without the egg it would be very crumbly and likely fall apart when trying to get it out of the pan.\n\nOther molecules that are good at connecting to polar and non polar molecules include soap and the lipids that make up your cell membranes."}
{"question": "eli5: Why do cheap lighters have a divide in their fuel reserve?", "human_answer": "Absolutely, this doesn't burn, it just moves a liquid around.   \nThis isn't like a candle wick that sits out the top, just something to get liquid to the valve and keep it there.  \n\n\nA screw adjustable valve like a tire valve sits on top, with a little brass jet nozzle, and that's where the gas comes out, and the flame will start just a little above that.  \n\n\nThe same principle as in a marker pen, it just needs to collect a liquid and keep it somewhere. In a pen, it'll just draw the ink to the nib and keep it damp. It's similar in this.  \n\n\nThe most likely reason is it's easier to make sure it's always boiling off the liquid at the top and controllable,  unlike if you had a large propane cylinder which would let out gas if stood upright, but if you tipped it on the side, it would spray out the liquid and you tend to get a way bigger flame.  \n\n\nTo keep it controllable and predictable, they'd want to to either always run off the pre-formed gas, or from the liquid, otherwise if you shook it, they could just turn into a flamethrower. It's likely easier to have the fibre rod damp all the time, than some method of making sure it never sucks up liquids and suddenly gets a far bigger flame."}
{"question": "Eli5: If water is transparent, why are clouds white?", "human_answer": "Clouds are white because they are made up of tiny droplets of water or ice crystals that scatter light in all directions. This is known as the Tyndall effect, and it causes the clouds to appear white to our eyes.\n\n\nTyndall effect is a phenomenon that occurs when light passes through a mixture of substances, such as water and air. The light is scattered by the tiny particles within the mixture, causing the light to appear different.\n\nIn the case of clouds, the Tyndall effect causes the light to be scattered by the tiny droplets of water or ice crystals that make up the clouds. This scattering causes the clouds to appear white to our eyes. The same effect can be observed when a beam of light passes through a glass of water, the beam of light appears to be scattered and the water looks cloudy.\n\nIt's also important to note that the Tyndall effect is not limited to clouds, but can be observed in other natural phenomena such as the blue color of the sky and the brown color of the smog.\n\nAdditionally, the sun is reflecting off the clouds, making them appear white.\n\nIt's also important to note that clouds can also appear gray, depending on their density and the amount of light they are reflecting."}

I spent 6/7 years studying sunscreen and why it wears off\n\nTwo main pathways to consider: does the sun break it down or does it wash away/get absorbed/some other physical method of degrading?\n\nFor the sun; sunscreen is generally speaking, for the main name brand formulations you buy, super photostable. That means that the sun doesnt cause sunscreen to wear away\n\nSo what about the physical methods? Yes, those definitely wear away sunscreen. Sunscreen is basically uv protection particles coated in a glue. Thats why it feels sticky! Sweat, water, towelling off, all remove that glue over time. These glues are pretty good dry, but fail fast in water (which is good, we need to wash it off at the end of the day)\n\nSo does that mean you can just put a lot of sunscreen on, don't move, and then youll not get a sunburn? \n\nKind of\n\nIt depends if you PUT ENOUGH ON IN THE FIRST PLACE.

{"question": "ELI5 - How can humidity in the air be measured as a percentage? How much humidity is 100%?", "human_answer": "It's not quite that air has a fixed amount of water it can hold. At the point where liquid water touches air, there are two things going on; some of the liquid molecules have enough energy to escape and become gas, and some gas water molecules hit the surface of the water and go back to being a liquid. The hotter the environment, the more likely the liquid molecules are to evaporate. The more water there is in the air, the more likely a gas water molecule will hit the surface and go back to being a liquid.  \nBecause the rates of those processes are difficult to measure, we measure the vapor pressure as a stand-in for the rate of evaporation, and the partial pressure of water as a stand-in for the rate of condensation. Relative humidity is how those two pressures relate to each other; a partial pressure of 10% means that the partial pressure of water in the air is 10% the vapor pressure of water at that temperature.  \nOver 100% humidity means that water is condensing faster than it is evaporating. This is when fog happens; the water in the air starts to condense with itself to form small water droplets. However, this condensation does take time, so the atmosphere does spend some time over 100%"}
{"question": "ELI5: Why does water expand in volume when freezed? Shouldn't it be more compact now since it is a solid?", "human_answer": "There are many different ways how ice crystals can form - around 20, actually! These differ in the way the water molecules are oriented against each other and depending on this way of packing the molecules, their densities are different.\n\nHowever, depending on the temperature and pressure of the environment, one crystal structure will be much more stable than the others and will predominantly form. At the usual atmospheric pressure on Earth and the temperatures that occur here, hexagonal ice forms predominantly, which is less dense than liquid water at usual air pressure (about 92% its density).\n\nHowever, if you get to drastically different temperatures or pressures, the most stable form of ice could be much more dense! At standard air pressure and below -200\u00b0C, the most stable form is Ice XI, which is 2.5 times as dense as liquid water at standard conditions. At room temperature but 25000 times standard air pressure, the most stable form is Ice VII, which is 1.5 times as dense as water at standard conditions.\n\nSo it\u2018s all a matter of the environment! There are many forms of ice that are more dense than liquid water, we just live in a world where ice that is less dense is the most stable form."}
{"question": "eli5: Why does wet earth (like right after rain) absorb more water then dry earth (like right after a drought)?", "human_answer": "I\u2019m a geotechnical engineer, so I\u2019d say I\u2019m pretty well qualified to answer this.\n\nIn ELI5 terms - clay soils when they dry up, shrink in size (several reasons for this, which is part of a theory called total stress, but that\u2019s beyond the scope of ELI5). The water content of the soil gives it some volume, less water, less volume. This causes the tiny little holes in the soil body to close up. This is where the water lives in clay soils, in these tiny little holes. As you add more water it becomes softer, take away the water, it becomes harder. \n\nRehydrating the soil, it needs time to \u201csoak\u201d to absorb the water back to a happy moisture content. If you pour water over the top it tends to flow over because it cannot absorb that quickly, due to the little holes being less prevalent. \n\nBecause of this principle, you tend to get a phenomena called heave, or shrink swell which is when clay soils can move (in some degrees measurable in 10s of millimetres) over the course of a year, and can lead to cracking or other structural issues with buildings and structures. \n\nThere\u2019s more to it, but that\u2019s as basic as I can make it without getting into total and effective stress, cohesive and granular soils etc."}
{"question": "ELI5 but if garbage dumps fail to facilitate decomposition due to the lack of an oxygen rich environment, why wouldn't the waste managers bore columns to pump in oxygen and good bacteria to compensate ?", "human_answer": "Modern landfills are constructed to be permanent storage for a toxic stew of no-longer-wanted items.  They're expensive to build and maintain.  They are most definitely not designed to compost because the compost one gets out would be so heavily laden with toxic compounds that it would be a crime to add it to any clean soil.  \n\nAs such, landfills are built to hold as much as possible before filling up.  Therefore everything inside is compacted as much as possible and then sealed off in individual cells from the outside world to prevent infiltration of things like rainwater which would then have to be collected and treated.  (This stuff is known as leachate and it's some of the nastiest stuff going.)  Anyway, this is the exact wrong way to build something if you were looking to pump air through it.\n\nThe idea that landfills compost was just what some civil engineers assumed would happen, because it was convenient to tell the residents at the time.  Nobody ever actually studied it for decades, until some dude decided to go check on the progress and actually mined down into one of the original NYC landfill sites.  What they found was that instead of composting, the landfills were PRESERVING the trash."}
{"question": "ELI5 Why are seafood's smells so strong and why are they so hard to wash off?", "human_answer": "To illustrate just how pervasive and \"smelly\" these chemicals actually are, here's an anecdote.\n\nI was working for a major global food manufacturer. We received shipments of dextrose syrup via railcar (essentially 95% glucose syrup derived from starch). Every order/railcar is inspected before taking receipt (once you agree to receive it, it's yours forever). This particular railcar, when a sample was taken, turned out to have a very slight fishy smell.\n\nWe hit pause on receiving and tried to track it down. The longer we investigated, the worse the smell got. We eventually identified it as trimethylamine, though our in-house GC couldn't detect it - it was lower than 0.1 parts per billion. An outside lab who's instruments could go down to 1 part per trillion identified it for us. We rejected the railcar, and I will never, ever forget that smell. It's not just general \"fish\", it's like fish + warning klaxon in your brain. Even though the concentration was in the low parts per trillion range, there wasn't a single person who couldn't smell it, and we all thought it was a very powerful aroma. \n\nAnd no, we never figured out where it came from (nor did the supplier).

{"question": "ELI5: How \"strong\" is the process of water freezing and what determines it?", "human_answer": "As water freezes in a closed container, the pressure rises, eventually topping out at about 30,000 pounds per square inch.  (Also, its freezing point drops; one of the things that happens when water doesn't have room to freeze is that it doesn't freeze very easily.  Getting it up to 30,000 psi is going to require cooling it all the way down to like -5\u00b0F or so.)\n\nAt that point, a more compact type of ice starts forming, called \"[ice III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_III)\".  Basically it forms tetragonal crystals instead of the hexagonal ones we're familiar with from things like snowflakes.  (The relationship between ice III and regular ice is a bit like the relationship between diamond and graphite: same substance, different structure.)  Unlike regular ice, ice III is denser than water, so if the container hasn't exploded by that point then it probably isn't going to.\n\nCan *you* make an ultra-high-pressure container that can survive 30,000 psi (plus a bit of a safety margin since ultra-high-pressure explosions are bad)?  Probably not, unless you have a really good workshop and some specialized knowledge.  But you could buy one online for ten or twenty thousand dollars; they *are* a thing that humans can make."}
{"question": "ELI5. Grapefruit juice and the effects on mental health medication?", "human_answer": "Medications are dosed assuming a certain percentage of them flat out won't work - your body will process some of them and kick them out prior to them entering the bloodstream.  One of the ways it does this is with the use of certain enzymes.  The problem is that grapefruit juice interacts with the enzyme, and if its tying up all the enzyme when you take a pill, it can't intercept part of the medicine.  Since the dosage is made assuming the enzyme will block some of it and it no longer does, you end up with a far higher dose than intended.  For mental health medication, this is a REALLY big problem - these drugs tend to have a narrow effective range vs. the range where they start having too many negative effects, and even if they don't, your doctor needs to know how much you are actually getting so they can adjust your dosage.\n\nWeirdly enough, there are some other drugs where grapefruit juice has the *opposite* effect for other reasons.  In these cases, the grapefruit juice is affecting proteins which transport the drug into your bloodstream.  Disrupt those, and you end up with *not enough* drug.\n\nGrapefruit juice is not the only food/drink that can cause these problems, but it's certainly one of the more notable ones."}
{"question": "ELI5: How do vitamin tablets get produced? How do you create a vitamin?", "human_answer": "I used to run the tableting department for the company that manufactured all of GNCs vitamins. To make a tablet you will have a blend of powder with the vitamins and minerals along with things to help form the tablet like binders, lubes, and disintergrants. The powder is then dropped into a tablet press that has a set of dies, upper punched, and lower punches. The tablet weight is set with the depth of the lower punch and the thickness with the depth of the upper punch, the punches go under a set of compression rollers that put the powder under up to 6 tons of force to make a tablet. After tableting a majority of blends will also get a coating. The coating can be used to affect the rate of disintegration, spike a certain vitamin or mineral if needed, and add/cover up flavors or scents. We also made soft-gel capsules like Vitamin E and Fish Oil. I never spent a ton of time in that department but the ingredients and gelatin are piped down to an encapsulation machine, the gelatin is flattened out into 2 ribbons, goes into a set of rolling dies where the ingredients are put in before forming a capsule. Then the capsules tumble around in a set of baskets for a while to cool and are trayed up to spend a day or so in the dryers."}
{"question": "ELI5: what is the difference between dishwasher soap, laundry soap and the barsoap I use in the shower?", "human_answer": "I can\u2019t speak to dishwasher soap, but hand soap/bar soap is traditionally made from a process called saponification where a strong base, oil and water are combined. This forms a compound which is hydrophobic on one side and hydrophilic on the other. This is what helps soap being able to clean, as the hydrophobic side can bond to other fatty acids and the hydrophilic side can bond to water to wash it away. As for the strong base, if NaOH (sodium hydroxide or lye) is used, the soap will be a hard bar. If KOH (potassium hydroxide) is used, the soap is softer. \n\nYou can use this soap to make laundry detergent, by grinding it up and mixing it other cleaning agents like borax and/or washing soda. This makes it less \u201csudsy\u201d so your washing machine doesn\u2019t overflow with suds, but still able to dissolve in the water and clean your clothes effectively. And typically it will be mixed with fragrance as well, since we are used to clean things \u201csmelling\u201d clean. That would be used for powdered detergent. If you want liquid detergent, this would then be added to water, as well as some type of gelling/thickening agent to help keep it all mixed and stay in suspension instead of separating out (which it will naturally do without those agents)."}
{"question": "eli5 how does cement and concrete become hard if it's only rocks and water", "human_answer": "This chemical reaction is known as hidrosis. Concrete can full cure after being mixed with out needing exposure to air. This makes it handy to use in thick slabs (although too thick, the temperature can run away), underground or even underwater. \n\nPortland cement has become increasingly expensive due to environmental concerns and restrictions. Adding to that the cost in development of new formulations to help in suppressing carbon (if it is suspended in concrete, it won\u2019t escape for quite a while). Coal ash, soot and other carbon inclusions can be added to a \u201cgreen\u201d concrete. Additionally, skilled labor and truck drivers are becoming hard to find too.\n\nConcrete used to typically have psi compression ratings of 2,500 to 3,500. Improved \u201ctypical\u201d formulas regularly are over 5000 psi. This would even be in your \u201ccheap\u201d concrete. Special formulas over 30,000 psi are  not common, but are available. \n\nYou can improve strength of your own projects by making sure they stay wet after setting for at least 28 days. Although the concrete may seem \u201cset\u201d the next day, hidrosis continues. Unless the water leaves the chemical reaction, usually through de-hydration.

{"question": "ELI5 why does chocolate sometimes develop a white coating?", "human_answer": "The white coating is a called a bloom and there are two types. \n\nOne is a fat bloom. It happens when the chocolate has been kept in a slightly too warm environment. It\u2019s not enough to melt the chocolate but the cocoa butter within it has softened/melted and come to the top. It then solidifies when the temperature falls and you get that white chalky coating. You usually loose a bit of the snap quality you get with higher cocoa solid content chocolates but it is totally fine to eat. \n\nThe other bloom is a sugar bloom. It happens with temperature shock or humidity. When you put chocolate from a warm environment (even just room temperature will often do it), then a cold environment like the fridge, a fine layer condensation occurs on the surface. This dissolves sugar crystals on the chocolates surface. When the sugar recrystallises it\u2019s forms the sugar bloom. It is usually white with a rough grainy texture and imperfections in the surface of the chocolate. Again it is fine to eat. The same thing can happen with high humidity without the temperature shock for the same reason, with condensation formation.\n\nEdit: wow. This blew up.

{"question": "ELI5: How do they create and test artificial flavors?", "human_answer": "The chemical processes are going to be dependent on the specific flavouring, many though are going to involve a group of chemicals known as [esters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ester), which are known for often having a fruity flavour and smell and do actually occur in fruits. You can make esters using chemical reactions, typically involving an acid (eg carboxylic acid) and an alcohol (eg ethanol or propanol).

It is instead a diketone and can be produced using a chemical called Butanediol, which we can get from various fermentation processes.\n\nEdit:\n\nAs for how you figure out flavourings, most basic ones will have been found out by taking some sort of food item and separating out it's components, then you see which of the components give the flavours from that food that you want. Figure out what that component is and then look at the chemistry to figure out how to replicate it. \n\nOnce you have lots of individual flavours, you can try combing them into more complex molecules and see if any of the combinations work nicely."}
{"question": "Eli5- how is radioactive waste properly \u201cdisposed of\u201d", "human_answer": "You put it in the ground very far away from anywhere any human is likely to return to (and where water or whatever can't move it close to any such place), and leave it to naturally calm down over centuries or millennia.\n\nThere's nothing else you can do to it, really. Since the problem is with the atoms themselves and not their chemistry, you can't put them into some chemical compound where they'll be safer. You literally just have to wait. In theory you could put it in a particle accelerator and try and blast the atoms apart into safer things, but that's *absurdly* energy-intensive and extremely slow, and there's no guarantee you'd end up with something that's actually safer in the end.\n\nAs a side note, the stuff that's really seriously problematic is the stuff that's *middlingly* radioactive. Really intensely radioactive stuff decays fast enough that it takes days or weeks for it to mostly have converted to other things. Stuff with half-lives on the order of years to centuries is the really awful stuff, because it's still more than radioactive enough to be dangerous but hangs around for long enough that you have to find some sort of permanent disposal solution for it - you can't just leave it in a shielded box in your lab for a few weeks."}
{"question": "ELI5 W; Why does hot water clean better than cold ?", "human_answer": "Yes, it's absolutely true. In the lab, one way we extract DNA is by using a detergent to break open the cells and dissolve the cell membrane and nuclear membrane, exposing the DNA. Yes, soaps and detergents (same thing) do help wash stuff away from the surface, that is also true. But soap alone kills germs, and they can never become immune to it (that's why washing your hands is important). \n\nIt takes detergent+friction to rupture the cell membrane, and often machines are not capable of generating the proper friction on all the interior spaces. A dishwasher, for example, can't actually scrub each individual dish surface. So instead they use heat (which also kills many microbes) to sanitize the dishes.\n\nWe cook food as a means to denture the protein content of meats, making it easier to digest and increasing the nutritional content. Cooked food is considered the primary reason humans were able to develop the large brains we had, as a result of the excess energy cooked food provides (fun fact: your brain uses about 20% of the sugar in your blood). Also, consuming soaps can give you diarrhea and be harmful to the good bacteria in your gut. All the squishing and churning your intestines do DOES provide enough friction to kill the good bacteria!"}

Oral Amiodarone takes longer to have apparent effects due to its lipophilic nature, but it\u2019s still active within hours of ingestion - it\u2019s just that it has a large volume of distribution due to its propensity to be distributed among tissue.\n\nWarfarin is metabolized and starts inhibiting VKORC1 within minutes to hours, with the effects noticeable within a few days.\n\nEtc etc.\n\nYou\u2019re confusing how long it takes a drug to get into your system/start having any effect, with how long it takes to reach a therapeutic level in plasma, with how long it takes to excrete.\n\nThose are three completely different concepts and it\u2019s actually *really important* to not conflate them.\n\nADME is separate from onset of action, which is separate from SSC."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why do grains have so many more carbs than other plant foods, like nuts or lettuce?", "human_answer": "Plants are basically machines for collecting energy, storing that energy in little packages along with DNA, then dispersing those energy packages in the hopes that new plants can use the stored energy to grow. \n\nSo how much energy you get from eating a plant part depends a lot on what this plant part is meant to do. Leafy green parts like lettuce are meant for collecting energy from the sun and don't hold a lot themselves. Nuts and seeds are meant for storing energy, so you naturally get a lot from eating them. Some plants like to encourage *us* to disperse their seeds by growing tasty fruits that we take and eat elsewhere. These can vary a lot in their nutritional properties. \n\nGrains are a kind of seed. We're very good at growing a lot of them, removing the outer shells, and cooking or grinding them to make the energy maximally available. If you did the same thing to almonds or walnuts, you would get something with roughly the same amount of calories. \n\nGrains have more carbohydrates, and other nuts have more fats. These are just different ways of storing energy. Carbs can be accessed faster and so are better for tiny seeds meant to quickly grow into small plants like wheat stalks. Fats are better for big seeds meant to slowly grow into trees."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why does a candle make no smoke when it is lit but makes a lot of smoke when you blow it out?", "human_answer": "It's not smoke. It's wax vapor.\n\nSolid wax can't burn.\n\nLiquid wax looks like it can burn, but in fact, it can't. Only wax vapor can burn (mixing with the oxygen of the air).\n\nWhen you put a flame on the wick, it melts the wax in the wick, but it vaporises some too. That vapor instantly catches fire (because the flame of the lighter is there).\n\nThe heat from the burning wax vapor melts some more of it, vaporises some more of it, which burns because there's a flame, and it's a cycle.\n\nYou interrupt the cycle by blowing the flame away.\n\nThe wax is still hot enough to evaporate a bit, but that vapor doesn't have a flame to light it, so it just slowly rises in the air, looking like smoke.\n\nA few seconds later, the liquid wax isn't hot enough to evaporate anymore. No more \"smoke\".\n\nIf this were true, then putting a flame in the \"smoke\" would make it catch fire, proving it's not smoke. You can do that experiment.\n\n1. Light a candle\n2. Light a lighter, put its flame above the candle\n3. Blow the candle out (without blowing the lighter out)\n4. As soon as you see smoke, make it run through the lighter.\n\nThis should make the smoke disappear.

{"question": "ELI5: Why we have only 118 elements in periodic table?", "human_answer": "It is required that the atom exists for at least 10 trillionths of a second (10 picoseconds) for it to be considered \"discovered.\" This is basically because it takes that long for the nucleus to gather electrons into stable orbitals (more or less. It's good enough for eli5).\n\nThe problem is above lead, there are no stable elements. All of them eventually decay. The bigger they get, the harder it is to keep them together long enough to be validated. There is nothing in physics that says it's impossible for element 119 to exist, but it's going to be very difficult to prove that we've actually discovered it.\n\nThe other thing is the way we discover them is by slamming two smaller nuclei together so they merge. The odds of them all sticking together properly is very dependent on how big the target is (size of the elements), how much energy (speed) is given to them, and how many of the elements you have to smash into each other. All three of these are tough to increase. Heavier elements take way more energy to reach the same speed, decay faster, and are more expensive. If we can manage to smash enough stuff together to make several hundred of element 119 at the same time, the odds of one of them lasting long enough to be verified goes up, but that's a tough ask."}
{"question": "ELI5: How does soap work?", "human_answer": "soaps tend to do two things: make substances that won't mix (like oil and water) able to mix, and they make water \"wetter\" in a sense, make it so water can contact things more thoroughly and make them slipperier and thus easier to dislodge.\n\nThe mixing thing is because soaps are based on fatty acids, which are molecules that are mostly long chains (oil-like) but have a small section that is polar (water-like).  The oils attach to the chain part of the molecule and the polar part attaches to water molecules, and allow both to be together without \"wanting\" to move apart.  More complicated in detail but that is the basic idea. \n\nWe generally use a base salt of the  fatty acid rather than the acid itself (replace the hydrogen of the acid with sodium, so soaps tend to be bases rather than acids).  That is, just like HCl is an acid but NaCl is a salt, H2O is an acid but NaOH is a salt, fats can be Na-Fat instead of H-fat.  Less harmful in most situations.\n\nThe wettening aspect (added slipperiness) is a bit more complicated but it is an aspect of the mixing of long chain molecules with polar molecules.\n\nSo, soapy water is more slippery than regular water and will dislodge dirt better, and can mix oil (and grease) into the water so it can be carried or washed away."}

Why does bacteria not build resistance from it if it's consumed daily?", "human_answer": "I mean, there clearly are evolved methods of surviving honey. It doesn't kill *you,* for example. Multicellularity, more selective cell walls, and the ability to enter \"stasis\" when dehydrated awaiting new water, and the use of spores are all methods simple creatures have evolved to survive exactly the kind of hazard honey poses. And as such, there *are* bacteria which can survive!\n\n\nIn fact, most honey is rife with bacteria! Even quite a few that can make you very sick. \n\n\nThere simply isn't enough time and evolutionary pressure for the common types of bacteria we treat with honey to develop counter measures. It is energetically costly and requires a whole lot of luck on the part of the bacteria. It is, however, *possible,* contrary to what you've suggested. \n\n\nBy your own metaphor, humans could possibly evolve fire-resistant skin capable of withstanding blowtorches if our environment was a hellscape of blowtorches, but it would require several lucky mutations.

{"question": "ELi5: Why does shampoo lather up so much more the second time around, and does this improve its cleaning ability?", "human_answer": "Additionally, the fact that it *is* lathering is a good indication that you don't need to go for a third round of washing. Once you get an obviously latherier\\* wash, you know you're running out of oils to wash out. Indeed, most shampoos (and dish soap etc.) actually have additional chemicals added to enhance the lather to maximise this \"oh good, it's working\" feeling - that's why you don't use washing up liquid in your dishwasher!\n\nOf course, it's worth noting that your scalp doesn't produce oil for no reason, it does several jobs including protecting your skin from infection and dessication. I personally don't wash the oils out with detergent at all and haven't done so for quite a few years. I do wash with conditioner clean it of non-grease dirt, and I brush my hair fairly often, which helps ensure the oils don't build up too much.\n\nIt takes a little time for your scalp to stop over-producing oil to compensate for constant removal, so if you fancy going \"NoPoo\", I recommend tapering off how much shampoo you use over a couple of weeks.

{"question": "Eli5: Why is Salt Effective on Everything?", "human_answer": "[Salt as a chemistry term](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(chemistry)) is fairly broad (and distinct from [table salt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_chloride), but still useful), but the general description reveals some things. It is a bunch of positive ions and negative ions that are relatively stable together but not too tightly bound to each other. This means that if there's a chemical interaction that needs any ions, salt has them right there.\n\nThings that work better with ions:\n\n* Dissolving into water because water likes holding ions, which is why icy roads and colder ice use salt\n* Moving electricity through water because it provides the electrons that are less attached to molecules, which is a minor reason why it helps with dehydration (nervous system is electrical)\n* Occupying water molecules because the ions also like to hold the water, which is why it is used in food preservation (and thus culturally means purity, which is why it works on ghosts)\n\nTaste wise, it is probably just a side effect of all the things our bodies use it for making our brains crave it (ETA: its use in kidneys is the biggest one, not the nerves as I implied above.

{"question": "ELI5: What does it mean when they say the flavor of a wine or beer is \"dry\"?", "human_answer": "A \"Dry\" beverage is one that does not have sugary or other sweet flavors.  Or more succinctly, dry is the opposite of sweet.  Think plain water, unsweetened iced tea, cranberry juice without added sugar.\n\nIt is important that the word \"dry\" only describes the absence of sweetness - not the presence of any particular flavor.  It is very much *not* a reference to leaving a dry or puckering feeling in your mouth - the word for that sensation is \"astringent.\"   This is probably the main source of confusion about what the word dry means in reference to beverages.  Astringency tastes very similar to the dryness we feel when talking about overcooked chicken or a sandwich with no condiments.\n\nOne reason we have a different word for the sensation of dryness in beverages is that astringent beverages actually are not dry in the everyday sense of the word.  A dry chicken lacks moisture; an astringent glass of wine that might give a similar sensation is quite literally a liquid.\n\nMany not-so-sweet beverages, like strong unsweetened iced tea or boldly flavored red wines do have a sort of drying sensation or flavor in addition to not being sweet - they are both dry and astringent.  No matter what other flavors or sensations may be present, \"dry\" refers to the absence of sweetness only."}
{"question": "ELI5 Why do dry-wipe pens stop permanent markers from working on a whiteboard?

They both use alcohol to keep the ink a liquid inside the tube. \n\nBut dry-erase markers have one more thing inside that liquid that lets them be wiped off of smooth surfaces, silicone.\n\nWhen you write on a dry-erase board both the resin AND the silicone come out onto the board. \n\nAnd here's what\u2019s neat, they dry at slightly different speeds! The silicone dries first, and then the pigmented resin dries ON TOP of the silicone. The ink isn't touching the board! Then when you go to wipe off the \"ink\" it is sliding off the layer of silicone that is underneath it.\n\nYou can see this sometimes if there is a side light on the board. You will see a \"ghost\" image of what you had written still on the board. This silicone needs to be disolved in order to remove it, so you need some \"board cleaner\". This is usually just the same isopropyl alcohol that is used to inside of the marker. \n\nSo why do dry-erase markers prevent permanent markers from writing on same surface?

{"question": "ELI5 When a beverage is advertised as \"More hydrating than water,\" how could that be physically possible?

Electrolytes are basically ions (charged atoms) that serve a huge variety of functions around our body that involve passing other molecules across cell membranes. They are  literally essential to life. We would die without electrolytes.  \nBUT\u2014and this is a big but\u2014it\u2019s not really clear how much you need to replace those electrolytes with a drink.

{"question": "eli5: Why is co2 the gas used to pressurize drinks. Why can\u2019t something like nitrogen or atmosphere air be used.", "human_answer": "Because CO2 dissolves in water very well. Just like certain solids like salt or sugar dissolve well in water, and some like sand or fat don't, gases also have varying degrees of solubility in water. Water is polar so polar stuff dissolves well in it. Gases like nitrogen have a lower solubility in water, so CO2 works better. \n\nAlso, CO2 is created by yeast (and basically all animals and fungi), so it is naturally occuring in fermented beverages, and thus is a gas with a long history of making drinks fizzy. \n\nRegular air is a bad idea since it contains a lot of oxygen, and oxygen will degrade the drink and it's flavors by oxidizing the flavor compounds. \n\nNitrogen (N2) is used in some beers, and creates smaller bubbles and a creamier texture since it is a denser gas, but this carbonation is lost more quickly as it is less soluble in water than CO2. \n\nNitrogen is also the gas of choice to push liquids through tap systems because it is quite inert, gives good pressure, and keeps oxygen out as it is denser. Nitrogen is a must for wine on tap because it will not dissolve as readily in the wine as CO2 would, whereas CO2 would add some degree of carbonation to the wine. CO2 is ok to use in beer tap systems, and is also less expensive than nitrogen. Many beer taps use a mix of the two."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why is wet bulb temperature important? How does it effect us?", "human_answer": "[there's a pretty good explanation on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wet-bulb_temperature#Intuition)\n\nIf a thermometer is wrapped in a water-moistened cloth, it will behave differently. The drier and less humid the air is, the faster the water will evaporate. The faster water evaporates, the lower the thermometer's temperature will be relative to air temperature.\n\nWater can evaporate only if the air around it can absorb more water. This is measured by comparing how much water is in the air to the maximum which could be in the air\u2014the relative humidity. 0% means the air is completely dry, and 100% means the air contains all the water it can hold in the present circumstances and it cannot absorb any more water (from any source).\n\nThis is part of the cause of apparent temperature in humans. The drier the air, the more moisture it can hold beyond what is already in it, and the easier it is for extra water to evaporate. The result is that sweat evaporates more quickly in drier air, cooling down the skin faster. If the relative humidity is 100%, no water can evaporate, and cooling by sweating or evaporation is not possible.\n\nWhen relative humidity is 100%, a wet-bulb thermometer can also no longer be cooled by evaporation, so it will read the same as an unwrapped thermometer."}

Women also struggle with this, unfortunately. The feeling is like being right on the edge and never able to get over it.\n\nA lot of the issues are psychological. But from some casual (potentially biased) reading there may be a feedback loop- too much serotonin resulting in an overstimulation of some neurotransmitter which causes another to be less effective.\n\nAnother theory is about the relationship with dopamine- which suggests more serotonin leads to less dopamine, the renowned \"pleasure\" chemical of the brain. If you've got less dopamine, your sex drive decreases and you're less inclined to feel stimulated from things.\n\nIn your case, PE doesn't need further stimulation, as the delay in ejaculation is likely a plus for your partner. It's not always the case, and if you're struggling, it may help to start with foreplay etc and compensate on the time it takes by mixing things around. Dopamine can also be increased by literally putting a smile on your face- gym, social interaction, yoga, meditation... All good ways to increase dopamine.

{"question": "ELI5: Where do free electrons come from", "human_answer": "When chemists describe metals, we use the term \"sea of electrons\" to describe the relationship the copper atoms have with other copper atoms that are touching. It's not that an individual copper atom has free electrons, it's at electrons within a lump of copper have the ability to move from one copper atom to the next. This is compensated by another electron moving in its place, so there is no net transfer of electrons and all of the atoms stay stat balanced to use your terminology.\n\nIn chemistry we use a concept called electronegativity to describe electron affinity, or how badly an element wants to gain or lose electrons. When you have something like a lump of refined copper, all of those copper atoms have the same electronegativity, or ability to hold on to their individual electrons. What makes a metal a metal is that it would actually kind of prefer to lose electrons (this is why lithium and sodium are so highly reactive), so they don't really hold on to their electrons very strongly allowing the Sea of electron effects. Other elements that are highly electronegative, like oxygen, really love to react with metals and form oxides (rust). This slightly low electronegativity, and ability to self bind and form large lumps of just copper, are why a chunk of copper has \"free electrons\""}
{"question": "ELI5: How does matter (on an atomic scale) get its color?", "human_answer": "On an atomic scale, atoms have different energy levels that electrons \"sit in\", when energy from a photon hits an electron, based on the energy of the photon it will cause the electron to jump to a higher energy level (or several higher)\n\nWhen the electron then releases this energy, it jumps from the higher energy level to a lower energy level, and depending on which levels it jumps between, will release a certain amount of energy as a photon which corresponds to a certain wavelength of light\n\nSo when you hear about objects really absorbing all but one color of light, what that means is that if something is purple, it's absorbing all the red and yellow and green (etc) light to jump to the higher energy levels, and then when it jumps back down it's expelling the energy of a \"purple\" photon\n\nMost things will release a few specific wavelengths of light (ie have multiple energy levels it jumps down between), that our brains meld together into a final \"color\", but you can actually see the individual colors using a fairly cheap  [spectrometer](https://www.teachersource.com/product/hand-held-spectroscope?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIxInfnf6d9wIV-AiICR06qwN7EAkYASABEgKZnPD_BwE) \n\nThere's reasons why different elements prefer to jump to/from certain energy levels but this part would be beyond my knowledge"}

And unlike sapphire, they have a less wide use in industrial and consumer applications, adding further to the cost and lack of interest to optimize their size. Meanwhile, large so-called boules of sapphire are used for very sturdy \"glass\" (not really a glass), and ruby is used for lasers.\n\nDiamonds however are quite finicky, they need quite extreme conditions to grow. Even more if one wants them to be extremely pure so that they are perfectly transparent.

{"question": "ELI5: why do some ice pops crystallize while others just become rock solid?", "human_answer": "theres 3 factors here. \n\nFirst is the rate of frezing. \n\nA slow freezing process will produce larger crystals, while a faster freezing will produce smaller crystals with a smoother texture, thats why its recommended that you cool down food to pre freezing temperatures (especially meat) so the freezing process is shorter. \n\nThe second is Agitation.  \nIce cream is churned, meaning its moved constantly and mixed to make sure ice crystals are distributed uniformly over the the mass of the liquid being frozen and breaking crystals that are growing too big, mantaining a smooth tecture.   \n\nThe third is impurities.   \nIcecream has several things mixed in to it which modify the texutre, fats, sugars, air, the air bubbles give it a smoother texture, the sugars interrupt the size of the ice crystals and the fats give you a different texture which limits the packing of the ice crystals. \n\nAlso an interesting thing about this is that in the making of many soft candies these 3 factors come in to play, the amount of water in a sugar mixture defines how hard a piece of candy will get, in toffee the mixture is agitated to put air in to it as to soften it and in many mashmellow recipies, the addition of a different sugar type (fructose) is added to disrupt the sugar crystal formation allowing a softer texture."}

{"question": "ELI5: Why does water make some things more slippery(like condensation on glassware) and some things less slippery(like wet jeans)?", "human_answer": "The top comments aren't really answering the OP's question, but I think the question may also a misunderstanding. If you're asking why wet jeans are harder to put on than dry jeans, it has to do with the *skin* being saturated by the water on the jeans, which causes the skin to have more friction with pretty much anything (including the jeans). The same would happen with glass--wet skin has more friction against glass than dry skin does.\n\nBut just speaking generally about water: it decreases friction in some things and increases it in others, but for different reasons. It fills the microscopic troughs in an object's surface, causing it to be lubricated and theoretically slide against another surface more easily. \n\nHowever, water also has an adhesive tendency, meaning it sticks to pretty much everything. This means that this adhesion (stickiness) may have more of an effect on the friction than the lubrication effect does. For example, think of two microscope slides. They're glass, which you mentioned as being more slippery when wet. But if you put a drop of water between two microscope slides, they actually stick together due to this adhesion. \n\nTLDR, there are a lot of things going on at the microscopic level, including some smaller effects that I didn't mention for the sake of brevity. \n\nHope this helps!"}

Next come \"hearts\", which are mainly ethanol and water, with a few esters in the mix.  Last come \"tails\" which tend to include fusel oils and other foul-tasting compounds.  Tails have a distinct wet dog smell and taste very bitter.\n\nThe art in distilling is knowing how much of the heads and tails to include with the hearts in the final product.  More expensive spirits add just a little heads and tails to give the spirit character while still tasting good.  Cheaper spirits will add back more of the heads and tails, because it increases the total amount of spirit produced, at the cost of including undesirable flavors.  Barrel aging can temper some of those off-flavors a bit, but you'll still get some odd flavors/smells.\n\nSource:  I work with a distiller"}
{"question": "ELi5: What are the \"natural flavors\" in soda water (La Croix, Buble, etc)? How do they make an organic (from fruit) flavor that is non-perishable, no calories, and is non syrupy?", "human_answer": "A mix.\n\nThings you'd probably expect - like lemon oil, orange oil, vanilla extracts, spice extracts. \n\nThings you'd expect, with strange processing - factionated lemon oils where they remove some parts and leave others, concentrated (folded) extracts where you use CO2 or hexane under pressure, leaving a tar-like super concentrate (solid extract/oleoresin) behind. \n\nEssences, which are water-phase extracts - you take a bunch of plant material, say, basil, put it in the top of a tower, pump steam in the bottom as the basil leaves fall down, condense and collect the steam at the top, boom basil essence. \n\nExtracts of things you probably never heard of (St. John's Bread, Neroli oil)\n\nNeat chemicals, pulled from plants. Ground black pepper has hundreds of flavor chemicals in it. You can extract and isolate those chemicals. If you want that wonderful cherry/vanilla note that black pepper has without the bite of black pepper, you can add heliotropin. And you don't have to get it from black pepper, cheaper to get it from dill, which also has it.\n\nOr do a reaction flavor, where you take a bunch of amino acids and some sugar and heat it under controlled conditions to create some complex earthy flavors like praline, chocolate, or savory meat.\n\nWhy no calories? That's just usage rate. LaCroix is probably 0.01% flavor."}
{"question": "ELI5: how does soap remove fats and oils if it\u2019s made of fats and oils?", "human_answer": "There\u2019s a rule of thumb in chemistry that similar substances dissolve each other well (\u201clike dissolves like\u201d). So fats and oils can dissolve other fats and oils, but don\u2019t dissolve well in water. But soap dissolves in water -what\u2019s going on?\n\nNormal fats and oils are triglycerides- three fatty acid chains (think long chains of carbons and hydrogens) attached to a glycerin backbone. When making soap, triglycerides are reacted with a strong base (eg potassium hydroxide) in a reaction called saponification, which causes the glycerin backbone to break off and the free fatty acids to form a salt with the potassium (or sodium if using NaOH) ions. Now the ionic end (the \u201chead\u201d) of the fatty acid salts dissolve well with water, and the tail of the fatty acid dissolves well with oils. And now we have something that can mix with both water and oils!\n\nWhen you wash with soap, the tail ends of the soap molecules attract oils on your skin, and the \u201chead\u201d of the soap molecules attract water. Because each end wants to be with its \u201cown kind\u201d, a bunch of soap molecules end up arranging themselves in a \u201cbubble\u201d where all the tails point inward, trapping a little ball of oil, and all the heads point outward, forming the water-soluble outside surface of this little bubble, called a micelle, and then all the micelles rinse away with the water."}
{"question": "ELI5: How can fast food often contain so much salt, without tasting salty at all?", "human_answer": "That's exactly what is going on.\n\nThere was a fear craze in the 1950s that fat creates heart disease, obesity, and everything else.  Ofc science has debunked that for 50+ years now, but people still hold on to this unfounded truth that \"fat makes you fat\", so companies decided to reduce fat in their processed food.  The problem is fat is flavor, so they had to up the salt and sugar to compensate.  This created the obesity epidemic.  How it works is fat fills you up, it satiates you, so with less fat you're more hungry.  With more hunger the average person eats more creating obesity.\n\nThen in the 80s another fear craze came out about too much salt, and also like fat it's unfounded.  Science since has shown a low sodium diet is worse for your heart.  Since then processed food companies have been finding ways to make food taste saltier with lower sodium.  This including adding even more sugar, but finding ways to make sugar not taste like sugar.  This in addition of simple carbohydrates and the reduction of saturated fats (eg switching beef tallow out for vegetable oil) has created a diabetes epidemic that we're now seeing.\n\nIf you want to eat healthy, follow recipes from the 1950s and earlier, or recipes that mirror those earlier principles like fine dining recipes, some low carb recipes, or foreign food that never fell to this influence."}
{"question": "eli5: If water is non-compressible, then why not use it in hydraulic machines instead of hydraulic oil?", "human_answer": "Water-based hydraulic systems do exist but they're quite unusual. \n\nThere are several reasons. \n\nThe first is water is corrosive, thus a hydraulic system using water would require expensive stainless steels to avoid rusting and pitting, leading to leaks. Not to mention the fluid becoming extremely dirty from fine rust particles.\n\nUsing various kinds of oils allows use of cheaper normal, non-stainless steels. \n\nHowever the shank of hydraulic pistons is often plated with a layer of chromium. This both resists corrosion on outdoor equipment, but also resists abrasion from ambient dust and dirt. Chromium is one of the hardest elements on the periodic table.\n\nThe second reason is lubrication. Oils have better lubrication properties. Thus sliding parts like rod and piston seals and wear bands last longer using oil. This is one reaon why hydraulic systems are very reliable. \n\nThe third reason is freezing. Water unlike most liquids expands with extreme forcep when it freezes. This could cause fluid lines to crack, seals to burst, or fittings to separate in subzero weather. In contrast, hydraulic oils contract and form a slushy gel when they freeze, which at worst causes the system to stop moving since fluid can't flow into various mechanisms. It may also cause small low pressure vapor bubbles to form in confined spaces. This isn't really an issue."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why do airlines throwaway single containers of liquids containing 100ml or more of it?", "human_answer": "In 2006 there was a failed attempt at terrorism that utilised liquid explosives disguised as soft drinks. Ultimately the plan failed because police surveillance managed to track down and arrest those responsible before they made it onto the flights but of course this raised a question about what could be done to prevent future plans like it. \n\nLiquids disguised as soft drinks could be used in two main ways, one would be as explosives and another as poison gas. Of course in order to transport them they have to be carried separately and once on the plane some sort of action has to be taken to mix the chemicals and trigger the reaction. So for starters requiring all liquids to be placed in a single sealed bag and inspected makes it easier for security staff to ascertain whether the bottles themselves hide any sort of mechanism or anomaly that points to them being used as bombs. I'm not entirely sure how the 100ml rule came to be but one can assume that it's considered not a large enough amount of any liquid explosive that could be disguised as a soft drink that would cause critical damage were it to be detonated. Sure you can bring multiple containers but you have to connect them somehow prior to detonation and any equipment for that can be spotted by security or if someone's mixing liquids in the cabin it will be noticed by crew and passengers."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why are the glasses shaped differently for red and white wines?", "human_answer": "Red wines tend to have stronger flavor compounds and tannins that soften when they \"breathe\" or decant.  The wider bowl of a red wine glass is believed to allow for more contact with the air, which means these soften a bit more and allow a greater distance from your nose to the wine so that the aromas aren't so intense.  The widest red wine glasses are Bordeaux glasses, because a lot of Bordeaux are high-alcohol and high-tannin, so the very wide shape allows both of those to mellow out much more.\n\nWhite wines, on the other hand, tend to be a bit softer with less intense flavors - the smaller size is because they don't usually need to breathe, and they let your nose get that little bit closer to pick up the subtle aromas.  Many white wine glasses also have slightly longer stems, because white wine is often served chilled, and that keeps your hand away from the bowl so that you're not warming up the wine with the heat of your hand.\n\nAt the end of the day though, these are minor things and they're all generalities.  I've had people insist on serving specific white wines in wider red wine glasses because they were higher-alcohol than is common, for example.  And there have been studies that show that for most people, the difference is negligible between glasses, and even for experts there are disagreements about the \"best\" glass for a particular need."}
{"question": "eli5 why nitrogen is more common in car airbags than argon? (Apparently)", "human_answer": "That is the general trend, but there are lots of ups and downs in the graph.\n\nIn general, it\u2019s because hydrogen and some helium were formed in the Big Bang, and everything else was formed by fusion in stars.\n\nAtoms are made up of negatively charged electrons and positively charged nuclei. Fusion only seems to happen in plasma, which is a state of matter where the nuclei and electrons are separated, so we can ignore the electrons. To fuse two nuclei, you have to overcome the positive charge that makes nuclei repel each other. The more protons the nucleus has, the more positive charge there is to overcome, and the harder it is to fuse the nuclei. The atomic number is the number of protons in a nucleus.\n\nStars like the Sun can fuse hydrogen into helium in their cores. Later on in the Sun\u2019s lifetime, it will be able to fuse helium and create slightly larger nuclei. Argon nuclei (atomic number 18) are harder to form by fusion than nitrogen (atomic number 7), so there is more nitrogen than argon. The picture gets more complicated when you start considering things like nuclear fission, but you get the basic idea.\n\nNitrogen is particularly common here on Earth, making up 78% of our atmosphere. If you have a room full of nitrogen and no oxygen, things can\u2019t catch fire in it (fire requires oxygen). I\u2019m sure you can think of some practical applications for that."}

How does government generate GDP?", "human_answer": "Agree that Des Moines and Elkhart-Goshen were surprises, and a bit hard to figure out just in terms of sources of wealth. My sense:\n\n* Large metro areas still include lots of surrounding suburbs and even rural areas. This chart doesn't just measure Boston plus Cambridge, but rather the eastern third of Massachusetts plus a slice of Vermont; Chicago's MSA goes deep into Illinois and includes part of Wisconsin and Indiana. The wealth of the city and rich suburbs gets diluted.\n* The distribution levels off pretty significantly after the top few. Numbers 12 through 39 are all in the $60-70k range, so it doesn't take a big increase to leapfrog most of them. \n* Large cities have huge economics and pockets of major wealth, but this is balanced by significant inequality and poverty. Some smaller and more homogenous metros likely have a lot of middle-class and upper-middle-class incomes. Des Moines isn't famously wealthy, but has solid finance and insurance companies.

{"question": "ELI5: When a company gets bailed out with taxpayer money, why is it not owned by the public now?", "human_answer": "The same reason that when you go bankrupt, you're not owned by your creditors. Bailouts aren't done for the benefit of the officers of the company, in fact the officers of the company are usually the first ones to be relieved of their jobs.\n\nWhen the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury stepped in to \"bail out\" insolvent banks in 2008, they actually became matchmakers for those insolvent companies to pair them up with other, not-broke banks. The not-broke bank took over the loan portfolio of the insolvent bank, and then the new, combined bank was provided liquidity to survive the merger intact.\n\nSo, for example, Countrywide was taken over by Bank of America, and Washington Mutual was taken over by JPMorgan Chase. The objective of the bailout wasn't to rescue the defunct bank's officers, or even their shareholders, but rather their depositors and customers. I was one of the Washington Mutual customers whose funds were rescued by the bailout, and now I'm banking with JPMorgan Chase because of it.\n\nWhat does the taxpayer get out of it?

{"question": "ELI5: what is a Roth IRA, how does it work, and what are the benefits?", "human_answer": "A Roth IRA is a type of IRA. \n\nSo first, an IRA is an Individual Retirement Arrangement ([not account](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/individual-retirement-arrangements-iras)). It's a way to save money for retirement. It's called an Individual arrangement because you set it up; it's not done through your employer. \n\nWhen you contribute to an IRA, unless you make over a certain amount, you can deduct the amount you contribute from your taxes. When you take the money out at retirement, you pay taxes on the money you take out.\n\nNow back to Roths. Roth IRAs are the same as traditional IRAs, except you don't get a tax deduction on the money you contribute. You pay taxes now, but you aren't taxed when you take the money out at retirement.\n\nAnother important difference is required minimum distributions (RMDs). With a traditional IRA, you must start withdrawing money from it when you reach a certain age. The reason is there's a huge lump sum on which you owe taxes, and the IRS would like those taxes. Roth IRAs have no RMDs while you're alive. Your heirs may need to take RMDs, but you do not.\n\nYou can open an IRA at any of the major brokerage firms (Fidelity, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, etc).

{"question": "ELI5: Why does the economy require to keep growing each year in order to succeed?", "human_answer": "It's kinda self-perpetuating. The economy grows because our whole economy is built around the idea of growth. We borrow against the future in the expectation of better returns, we invest in the future in the expectation of future gains.\n\nAnd within this system, individuals demand growth. Would you like to get a pay rise next year?  Where's that money/stuff/welfare going to come from? Either from growth (more money available), or from redistribution (taking from one to give to another) - with the obvious snag that redistribution means someone else has to have less money/stuff/welfare. So growth in the economy enables growth in individual wealth, welfare, and lifestyles. Lack of growth means stagnation. Recession means falling living standards.\n\nThis is all putting aside the population size point, which I think is actually incidental to the point. Even with a stagnant population, you would still need growth for the above reasons.\n\nNow, it's possible to imagine a post-growth economy but it's pretty hard. There are big conversations around de-growthing the economy because infinite growth implies infinite consumption of resources, and we ain't got infinite resources. It sort of shakes the very foundation of how everything works."}

Each share is a tiny slice of the total stock and thus represents a tiny slice of ownership of the company.\n\nAs of today, one share of MSFT, i.e. one unit of investment, is worth about $245. If you buy 10 shares of MSFT stock, you'll own about $2450 worth.\n\nThere are about 7.45 billion shares of MSFT stock in existence. That means the market capitalization (market cap), or the theoretical value of Microsoft the company based on the number of shares times the price per share, is about 7.45 billion x $245 = $1.84 trillion. \n\nThat doesn't mean Microsoft could cash out today and get $1.84 trillion or that the company's assets are worth that much, just that it's the theoretical value of their stock if everyone sold their shares at the current price. If everyone went out and tried to sell their MSFT shares right now, there would be lots of sellers and few or no buyers, so the supply would exceed the demand, and so the share price would rapidly plummet towards zero."}

{"question": "ELI5: Doesn't factoring depreciation into the cost of car ownership rely on the assumption that you will eventually sell that car? If so, why is that a reasonable assumption?", "human_answer": "Depreciation is recognizing the cost today of replacing an item in the future, based on how much of it you used up.\n  \nIn the business world this is important because if you don't take that loss of value into consideration, it can misrepresent the company's actual profitability by failing to take into account that some portion of your revenue will need to go to investing in new equipment eventually to stay at the current level.\n\nThe IRS typically allows businesses 7 years to \"straight line\" depreciate assets, but companies can use any of a number of ways under generally accepted accounting principles to depreciate assets' book values. These could be units produced, cumulative uptime, % of service life, etc. This is the major basis of the \"tax-book difference\" of assets, and one reason why companies have tax credits that appear to reduce their tax rate in a given year: they may have depreciated an asset only 1/10 if its value one year, but they could only claim 1/7 of its value on taxes, for example.\n  \nAnyway, as it relates to personal finance, the fact that your vehicle is going to have no value to you at some point (regardless of when) means that you should be treating the replacement of the vehicle as a cost you need to account for today."}

So the US government steps in and says \u201cactually\u2026 we\u2019re gonna put a tariff on those Chinese cookies.

Some people who are hurting will take the money only to cover things that they were struggling to cover before, and they will therefore contribute little to new demand. Others like middle class Americans who were able to weather COVID and the economic downturn were able to spend the extra money more freely on stuff they would have otherwise abstained from for a little while. They are the bigger contributors to inflation. But THIS time around, what really made things crazy was the supply chain. Companies let go of so many people with years of knowledge when things got bad, and now are trying to turn everything back on with a less experienced workforce and with new demand. On top of that, the economic downturn was unusual in that usually it takes time to rebuild trust in the markets, but since everything shut down strictly because of a virus, companies were waiting to start things up again as if all was normal again once restrictions were eased. Now throw in that everything is more expensive to ship because of Russia\u2019s war screwing up oil supplies, and you have a recipe for price explosion."}
{"question": "ELI5: How can a recession see a drop in profits and a rise in poverty? Where does all the money go, if not to the businesses or people?", "human_answer": "Money these days is usually just numbers in a bank's computer. The bank can lend you a million pounds to start a business - just by creating a new account for you with a million pounds in it, if they want - then write off the debt when you can't pay it back. Did that add or remove money from the world? It barely matters, as long as people still trust the bank.\n\nI like to try imagining a recession in a world without money. Let's say in a stone-age village, the shaman declares that the sky gods will give everyone great treasures if they build a huge stone circle. Lots of people take part in the project, setting aside the normal stuff they would be doing. They beg food from other villages, promising to pay them back later. They all anticipate great wealth in the future. The people in the other villages also believe they will get rich when you pay them back.\n\nWhen the stone circle is complete and nothing happens, the people who felt rich now feel poor, even though nothing in the physical world has changed. The same kind of thing can happen in the financial world with bad debts, stock market crashes, cryptocurrency, etc. You think you're rich, and then you find the thing you have is worthless. It's not the money that's disappeared, it's the perceived value of stuff."}
{"question": "ELI5: How are energy companies in the UK going bust but also having colossal profits?", "human_answer": "Energy producers and energy suppliers are two different things.\n\nEnergy producers are those who have the solar/wind farms, the power plants, the oil and gas extraction infrastructure, etc.\n\nEnergy suppliers are those who buy electricity /gas / etc from the producers and sell it on to retail customers like you and me.\n\nThe producers are making bank.\nThe suppliers are in the middle trying to turn a profit with rapidly changing supply prices, but long-term contract commitments which forces them to supply fuel at pre-negotiated rates way below the cost that they are having to buy the energy for. I, for example, am currently in the middle of a 2 year fixed rate deal which means my supplier has to still charge me the cost of gas as we agreed in summer 2021, even though the actual electricity and gas prices they are now paying are much higher.\n\nThe market in the UK is pretty screwed up anyway; privatisation led to some really gnarly relationships between suppliers, producers, and the power operators / infrastructure managers. We also had some deregulation of supplier provision which led to an influx of small suppliers who were trading on the edge of affordability. When they got whacked with massive price hikes they didn't have enough in the bank to smooth over the cracks."}
{"question": "ELI5 How does a recession or market crash stop inflation?", "human_answer": "This is a layman\u2019s explanation.   I\u2019m sure the topic is much more complicated but this is my basic understanding of the current circumstances.\n\nThe market has been rally due to an inflated supply of money.   Basically over the last two year tons of money has been printed making money cheap.   Cheap loans, lots to invest, etc.   however the more dollars there are the less valuable each dollar is worth.   Inflation.\n\nThere\u2019s also some global issues, wars and supply changes that are exasperating the issues.   (I.e.   we can produce enough microchip however the supply changes aren\u2019t keeping up with demand causing scarcity and increasing prices as well)\n\nWhat is happening now is a tapering of the money supply as a result of the devaluing of the dollar.   The FED is starting to print less and less money to reduce the supply and limit the dollar devaluation, however this makes money less accessible and more valuable.   Since there\u2019s less money loans are harder to get, and people have to be more choosy where they invest.   Hence less capital to the markets stunting growth.   Since the supply was so inflated and they really need to hit the breaks on money printing this can cause the market to crash, but it also lowers inflation.\n\nThis is the basics as best as I can describe."}
{"question": "eli5 Why is the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 so ineffective against companies today?", "human_answer": "you have a few situations that  create this \n\n\n1:the company has no legitimate competitor that is willing to step into the market: this is the least likely one but its a possibility in some commodities because said company might own the infrastructure required and/or getting into this market requires a major investiment(this is often the case on companies that provide utilities, sure they cna have compeition but unless they lay their own lines and supply systems theyll be  at best just buying share space in existing infrasturcutre)\n\n\n2: the company is VERY large, but not ot the point where it strangles the market, as in these laws are not menat ot punish large companies,  but to punish companies that take active efforts to prevent market competition. you cant exactly enforce the idea said companies cant grow if their business plan allows for it.\n\n\n3:the company is engaging in shady practices but their audience is captive: this is oftne because #1  is also in place but instead of a lack of competitors its because of a lack of willingness ot enforce and compete because you do need the service provided.\n\n\ndo note however: these acts  are not meant ot keep a company from growing, they exist to prevent anti competitive behaviours that would strangle their respective markets."}
{"question": "ELI5: If a borrower is high-risk, why do banks make it harder for them to pay off loans?", "human_answer": "Say you have $10,000, and you want to turn it into $11,000 by loaning it out.\n\n- You loan $100 to 100 people in low-risk Group 1.  Three of them will default; you'll get $0 from those.  To get $11,000 back from the remaining 97, you need $11,000 / 97 or $113.40 each.  You need to set Group 1's interest rate is 13.40%.\n\n- You loan $100 to 100 people in high-risk Group 2.  Ten of them will default.  To get $11,000 back from the remaining 90, you need $11,000 / 90 or $122.22 each.  You need to set Group 2's interest rate is 22.22%.\n\nYou're suggesting the default rate depends on the interest rate.  So let's suppose we have Group 3, in Group 3 we set the interest rate such that 9 of them will default.  Doing the same math, Group 3 gets $11,000 / 91 or $120.87 each; you need an interest rate of 20.87% to achieve your $11,000 goal.\n\nThe critical question is then *how far do you have to drop the interest rate to make one less person default?*\n\nIn other words, *does dropping the interest rate from 22.22% to 20.87% lower pressure on borrowers enough to save one loan out of 10 that would normally have defaulted?*\n\nIn theory, it's qualitatively possible that this could indeed be the case.  In practice, you'd need some real quantitative data about actual consumers to answer this question."}
{"question": "eli5: is the price of crude oil i see on the futures market the same as the actual price refiners are paying?", "human_answer": "In many cases, they aren't. For stuff like oil, electricity etc. , there are two big markets. The spot market for customers(refiners) who want things NOW and the future market where customers (refiners) want to make contracts for future transactions. \n\nThe spot market doesn't contain an extra tax for getting assurances. You simply pay the current price for the crude oil. If I want to get X liters of oil in the future, some seller might do it but wants to get extra money for assuring you to deliver the oil in let's say 1 year. The oil price might be higher, the oil price might be lower. One party is always winning in this deal, but the seller will charge you a bit of extra money to put this deal more in their favour. \n\nMost of the times, the actual prices are wastly different. Refiners could pay the price of the spot market since they didn't make any contracts preemptively. If they made contracts on the future market, it depends incredibly on the market sentiment, on the time span you want to get your oil delivered etc.  If you as a refiner got a contract one year ago for today, you certainly got a deal in your favour (who could have anticipated such a rise one year ago?). If you made a contract one month ago for today, not so much. Everyone knew about the oil shortage already."}
{"question": "ELI5 how does life insurance make sense, like how does $40/month for 10 years get you 500,000 life insurance?", "human_answer": "There are these people who LOVE numbers, they are called Actuaries. \n\nInsurance companies hire these people to figure out all sorts of Probabilities, or the chance something will happen, based on things they can measure, like age and sex and weight and health and smoking and location and distance to fire hydrants and number of speeding tickets and credit rating.  \n\nThen the insurance companies ask these Actuaries something like \u201chow many males aged 35 now, who are in decent health and don\u2019t smoke do you think will die on the next 10 years?  To which these number lovers will say 1 in 20.  \n\nThe insurance company them makes a Life Insurance Policy and says for $4800 over the next 10 years, I will pay you $500,000 if you die.  It then tries to get lots and lots of people to sign up for them.  Once enough people do, and if their Actuaries are good at their jobs, they will make $960k from every 20 policies on 35 yr old men in decent shape that don\u2019t smoke.  And payout $500k to the 1 person that dies.  \n\nWith the remaining money they pay the actuary, they pay for advertising, they pay the agent that sold you the policy and for the buildings etc.  finally if they made a profit they pay the shareholders.  \n\nInsurance at its core is just the spreading of risk over a large group of people."}
{"question": "Eli5: how do movies that go straight to streaming generate money?", "human_answer": "It can generally work one of two ways: \n\n* Someone can make a movie that they maybe want/hope to be in theaters, but no one wants to buy it and put it in theaters (marketing movies and putting them in theaters is what \"distributors\" do, if you ever hear that term). If no distributor wants it, they can then sell it to a streaming service. In that case, it's almost always a flat fee to the producers of the movie which hopefully at least covers their costs of making the movie and maybe some profit too. For a movie like Prey, likely tens of millions went from Hulu to the producers. So Hulu pays and then it's up to Hulu to hope that they get enough interest in the movie to create increased subscriptions or people not cancelling that were going to cancel or from ad revenue to cover that cost (and hopefully make a profit). \n* The other option is that the streaming service is involved from the beginning and is part of financing the making of the movie itself. Netflix has been doing this a lot. In that case it can be more complicated at least as far as how Netflix might be paying out to any other producers. If Netflix is putting up all of the money, then it's not even an issue. They are just hoping what they spend makes enough people want to have Netflix subscriptions to help cover their spending."}
{"question": "Eli5: How do countries recover from hyper inflation?", "human_answer": "Generally very tough road once hyperinflation takes place. Hyperinflation is only partially an economic issue - it is almost always a government policy issue. Corrupt and/or inept governments enacting unsustainable fiscal and monetary policy. \n\n1) The \"stick it out\" route. The country keeps reissuing new currency that simply revalues existing currency. Hope to stabilize the economy in the mean time and avoid social unrest, civil war etc. Generally very low chance to succeed since the people in power who got the country there in the first place aren't that economically savvy.\n\n2) Issue new currency and peg it to some other currency or commodity (gold). Hard to do without assistance since the economy is likely in shambles. In modern times, this probably requires the support of something like the IMF and World Bank and other governments and financial institutions (willing to lend to refloat the economy)\n\n3) Dollarize. Abandon the currency and no longer issue currency. Formally adopt a foreign currency for domestic and international transactions. Usually the USD (hence the term) but, in theory, could be any currency. Informal dollarization occurs when citizens and businesses do this anyway and refuse to transact or hold local currency. Formal dollarization is the government actually doing this."}
{"question": "Eli5: How can some country have trillions of dollar in debt like Japan but still functional without any consequences?", "human_answer": "Modern Monetary Theory (MMT, aka the model that countries usually use and say they don't) says you have 2 buckets:\n\n\\[Government Money\\] and \\[Private Money\\]\n\nThe way the private economy gets along depends on having enough money in circulation to satisfy demand without overrunning demand. We never want too much money chasing too few goods.\n\n\\[Private Money\\] is added to by Government Spending, subtracted from by taxes.\n\n\\[Government Money\\] is added to by taxes and, subtracted by debts and Government Spending.\n\nDid you catch that? Where do debts go? That's right, into the \\[Private Money\\] bucket.\n\nGovernment debt is economic stimulus. A Government bond is basically the same as a piece of currency, except it provides interest.\n\nSo, debt is normal, it means the government is doing things to keep the economy running.\n\nNow, if your government also *issues currency*, like Japan does, then ultimately, the money in its bucket doesn't really matter. It can increase or decrease spending, and debts, raise and lower taxes, and there's no balance sheet that has to be maintained on the \\[Government Money\\] bucket.\n\nThe government does have to ask the private economy to do things that it *actually is capable of doing*, though, otherwise, you get too much money chasing too few products. Again, that's bad."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why is the rising cost of housing considered \u201cgood\u201d for homeowners?", "human_answer": "For a while in the 1990s or the early 2000s in the San Francisco area,, the AVERAGE increase in value of a standard house was about $100,000 a year. Imagine that, you just living your life and each week your house makes you $2000.  Next week, $2000 more. \n\nHow is this good for the home owner?  You are correct that if they sell their house and buy next door there is not any real advantage to them. However, if we assume that the house is otherwise paid off this is how it is good for them...\n\nThe home owner borrows $100,000 against their house, buys a new Mercedes, and takes a 2 week trip to Europe. Now they owe $100,000.  A 30 year note at 3% would be about $421 a month for a payment, but they pay more (because they can) and after a year they owe $75000 on that loan.  Next year their house is worth $100,000 more, so they take a new $100,000 loan, pay off the first one and then use the $25,000 extra to upgrade their kitchen, so now ther house is worth an additional $25,000...\n\nAnd they could keep doing this never owing more than $100,000 at the cost of $421 a month.\n\n...and when they do sell after 15 years, they take their $2milllion dollars from selling the house and buy a 90 acre pice of land in Wilson County Tennessee with a nice house on it for $500,000, and put the $1.5 million in the bank."}
{"question": "ELI5: The US has had a trade deficit since 1975, so is the US trade deficit really such a bad thing?", "human_answer": "Is it bad?  Depends on your point of view.  The general outcome of constant loss of money from inside to outside is devaluation of the currency, reduction in real value of wages, and loss of purchasing power.  Why can't the average worker buy a house now when 50 years ago a single-earner with 2 kids could?  Part of the reason is that the money we make now is worth a lot less, because of things like eternal trade deficit.  Not the only factor, but definitely part of the picture.  \n\nIt is not just that housing costs have risen so fast, but that real wages have stagnated, in part because we lack money coming in from trade to support wage increases.  When we buy from there, it means we are not buying from here, and the people involved in making that stuff here lose their good-paying jobs, and take wage cuts if they can even keep the job at all.\n\nThe bigger problem isn't simply because of negative earnings for the country as a whole, but that the losses are primarily from manufacturing of goods.  We don't have the infrastructure (factories) or labor pool to manufacture many goods anymore, so if we had to (like because of war or some major economic catastrophe), we would suffer quite a bit until the problem got fixed. Can't build and man factories with trained staff overnight; takes time and money."}
{"question": "ELI5 How are large sums of money transferred between nations?", "human_answer": "Domestically, when someone at Bank A sends money to Bank B, no money actually changes hands. Bank A deducts funds from your account and Bank B credit funds to the recipient\u2019s account. Then the two banks settle the transaction by crediting and debiting their bank accounts with the national reserve bank (Federal Reserve, Bank of England etc\u2026). To make it easier the banks will batch thousands or millions of transactions in both directions and pay the net difference once a day or so. \n\nFor international transfers there is no global reserve bank. So, the banks do it with each other in a system called correspondent banking. To send cash from a Bank of America customer to a Royal Bank of Scotland customer, BofA will have cash on deposit at RBS. When RBS credits their customer they reduce the cash balance of BofA\u2019s account. If you don\u2019t have a correspondent banking relationship set up with the destination bank, other banks will step in as intermediaries. \n\nA \u201cwire\u201d transfer is just the message used by all the banks to authorize all the transactions. \n\nIn the case of a government sending money to another government, they both have bank accounts at a regular bank and process it just like they were regular customers. Or a government will have funds on deposit internationally and get it debited from there."}
{"question": "ELI5 Why do airlines continue to raise prices as the flight gets closer to takeoff?", "human_answer": "It's much simpler than most people are making it out to be.  It's supply and demand, not an evil computer algorithm or board room of suits assuming their late booker is a business customer.\n\nWhen there are more empty seats than people who want to fill them, price goes down.  When there are more people wanting to take the flight than there are seats, price goes up.\n\nTo price gouge based on an idea like 'a late booker is in an emergency, or has an employer paying who doesn't care' doesn't really make a lot of sense.  You'd be flying empty seats(lost revenue) that would have gone to opportunistic flyers, loyal customers that tried a competitor just because of the poor market pricing, etc.  There are ways to solve some of these problems, but they are expensive and require a lot of technology implementation in a business that's world famous for being decades behind technologically.  It's dead simple to price based on seats remaining.\n\nImagine a local hotel.  They can constantly keep up with public events, conferences, concerts, etc and attempt constant pricing updates based on that expected demand, constantly paying to do so, and taking a bath when they are wrong, or they can set a rate based on rooms booked(first 20% of rooms at x rate, next 20% at x+2, etc) and easily collect profit based on demand."}

A lot of times if it\u2019s less common, the drug has to be ordered from a supplier. Most pharmacies have contracts with one and they can submit an order online. Usually comes the next day or the day after. \n\nWhen a prescription is electronically sent over or a patient brings a hard copy, we have to enter or process it in.

Once it\u2019s filled we verify it one more time and it\u2019s ready to be sold.

{"question": "ELI5: Why does the Coca-Cola company only sell 70 brands in the US but sells over 500 worldwide? Is there a marketing reason?", "human_answer": "It is not like every country outside the US have 500 different Coca-Cola brands. Actually 70 brands is quite much and most countries only have about 20 Coca-Cola brands available. The thing is that a lot of those 70 brands you find in the US does not sell well in the rest of the world. People have different tastes, they respond to different marketing and the competition is different. So Coca-Cola have made different brands for the different countries. Actually a lot of the 500 brands is just mineral water sold under different names in the different countries. Others are brands which became popular before getting bought out by Coca-Cola and is still produced due to their popularity.\n\nOne famous example is when Coca-Cola introduced Dasani in the UK it was a disaster. Firstly the marketing did include words that unbeknownst to them were unfortunate British slang terms. But then the media published that Dasani was just tap water, similar to most Coca-Cola water brands but unlike a lot of the competitors. Then there were concerns with the levels of bromide in the water (Coca-Cola later tested the levels in their California facilities causing the city to introduce the famous shade balls). So Coca-Cola withdrew the Dasani brand from the UK and bought up Abby Well instead, later on they also introduced Smartwater."}
{"question": "Eli5: Why is the U.S. Dollar so powerful?", "human_answer": "The same thing that makes any currency powerful: Demand for the products you can buy with it. A better question to ask is, \"Why aren't other currencies as strong?\".\n\nThe simple answer is size and *safety*. There are only so many economies on a scale of the American economy, so the possible contenders for a substitute for the U.S. dollar as the de-facto reserve currency of the planet would be the Euro and the Yuan. Both of those currencies have some fundamental problems which keep them from being more enthusiastically adopted.\n\nIn the case of the Euro, the problem is the currency is not backed by a unitary state, and in a larger geopolitical problems plaguing the EU, like Brexit, the various economies in crisis which are part of the trading bloc, do not support investor confidence.\n\nIn the case of the Yuan, there's a unitary state, and certainly nobody thinks China is going to up and vanish, or break up, but investors are even more distrustful of the PRC leadership than they are of the fragmented confederation of the E.U.\n\nAnd once you exclude those two countries, there's really not much in the way of options.

All other nearby countries are economically and militarily weak. Any time a country can focus on its navy it's in a good position to exert power abroad.\n\nLots of fairly flat and fertile land to farm. The easily navigated Mississippi river providing cheap transport both throughout the land and to the sea. Loads of various natural resources making them dependent on noone. \n\nAdd into that the initial advantages of being a european settlement - technology and good trade opportunities - and you have a nation that got rich quick. Wealth and security = power.\n\nEdit: Please stop with all the 'but slavery' comments. Yes slavery was exploited by the US to help it grow. No it was not a deciding factor in the country becoming a superpower. Most countries in the world have exploited slave labour at some time or another. Very few had some let alone all the above advantages (and miles of coastline full of natural harbours as another pointed out) to become the dominant global power.

{"question": "ELI5 Why is the US\u2019 credit rating so exceptional despite the amount of debt it takes on?", "human_answer": "The govts relationship with the word \"debt\" is very different to yours or mine. This is on account of the fact that the govt creates the money needed to pay its debts. And they do this ALL the time.\n\nThink of where money comes from. Its a human construct - we dont dig it up out the ground like a commodity, so someone has to have created all the money in circulation. That someone is the govt. Every time a govt spends, it does so through new money creation. Not tax. Not borrowing. Creation of new money. Indeed, there is no mechanism within the central bank to spend any other way.\n\nOnce the govt spends its new money, it then taxes back some of it in order to control inflation, control behaviour (taxes on alcohol, fuel, cigarettes etc), and make more fiscal space for further spending. \n\nThe national debt is the sum total of every unit of currency spent by the govt and not yet taxed back. It is nothing to be worried about and will continue to rise indefinitely. \n\nI hugely recommend picking up The Deficit Myth by Stephanie Kelton. It tackles this topic in a really easy to understand way and lays waste to many of the myths surrounding the money system.\n\nAlso, ive deliberately chosen not to specify dollars, pounds, or any other currency in my post, because regardless of where you are, this is how things work for a currency issuing govt."}
{"question": "Eli5 if the nosferatu movie is now public domain why does it need to be rented to be seen are you still able to make money off things after they are public domain?", "human_answer": "When something is copyrighted, all that means is if the one who holds the copyright spots you making a copy and giving it to someone else, without their express permission to do so, they can point and shout, \"POLICE! THEY'RE STEALING MY WORK!\", and government-funded police will be compelled to stop you, and slap you with an appropriate punishment.\n\nWhen a work is in the public domain, it means no one has that kind of legal right.

That includes packaging it up and trying to sell it to people who you think will pay money for it.\n\nA streaming service or a movie rental store asks you to pay not because they have any kind of copyright on the film itself, but because they are operating the infrastructure that it takes to deliver the movie to you on-demand, and they want to be compensated for keeping that running.\n\nTap water is free (or nearly free, to some extent) and you can get it in all sorts of places at any time, but sometimes you may be willing to shell out cash for a bottle of water filled from that same tap.

{"question": "ELI5 Why is it that companies in Europe (i.e Germany, France, etc..) charge less than places in the US and Canada?", "human_answer": "I think there's a few reasons. \n\nEurope has more competing brands for consumer goods. In some places, there's also more competition in retail (as opposed to North America where you've got towns with 2 grocery stores and 1 Walmart each several miles away from each other). Each country had its own consumer goods manufacturers and retail chains, and then they faced Europe-wide competition. \n\nEurope also has higher consumption taxes, lower disposable incomes, and different spending habits. North Americans simply have the capacity to spend more money, and they tend to go into debt more. European populations are older; more of their people grew up in austere conditions; and they were introduced to credit cards and consumer financing later-in-life. Did the difference in culture lead to the economic differences or did the economic differences shape the culture? Maybe both. Even within Europe there's different approaches to shopping,  like how the Germans are stereotypically more thrifty than the French. \n\nI've never heard anyone describe Switzerland as inexpensive. But as far as day-to-day consumer goods go, they at least have the lower VAT (so companies selling something in France/Germany/Italy can multiply their EU price by 1.15ish and it ends up being comparable in Switzerland; but it tends to be more because the Swiss have more money)."}
{"question": "ELI5 how is the US banking system not crippled by credit card fraud?", "human_answer": "While credit card fraud is a problem, it\u2019s not overwhelming to banks. \n\nJust like stores expect some shoplifting and include the costs of that in their prices, banks expect some fraud and include those costs in the fees they charge. \n\nBanks also have lots of ways to detect fraud, and can often catch it before there are too many charges. They have algorithms that look for charges outside a customer\u2019s normal area, at places they don\u2019t normally shop, etc. When I\u2019ve had a fraudulent charge, the bank itself has always been the one to catch it and call me. \n\nAlso, you need more than a credit card number to shop. In person, you need the card itself. If a store runs just the number off a piece of paper, they would be liable for the charges. Spoofing cards is harder, especially the new chip cards. Online, you typically need the security number from the back of the card and the billing address. You can buy full sets of stolen data, of course, but it\u2019s harder than straight numbers. \n\nAs to why every criminal in America doesn\u2019t take up credit card fraud, on the whole a lot of crime is opportunistic rather than carefully planned. Someone needs money *now*, so they smash a window or bump key a door, grab some stuff, and leave. Or rob someone in person. Credit card fraud takes start-up capital (to buy the devices and numbers), planning, and patience."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why is gold inherently more valuable and has historically been used as the foundation of monetary systems instead of any other random element?", "human_answer": "Three main reasons:\n\nFirst off: It's relatively rare. Because there is a limited amount of it, and it's not easy to get more, you don't (usually) have a problem with it losing value because suddenly there's a lot more of it. Tied to this is that it is hard - almost impossible - to destroy, meaning it also isn't going to gain value because suddenly there's a lot less of it.\n\nSecond: It's shiny, soft, and malleable. This makes it something that people want because it looks nice and can be made into nice-looking things.\n\nThird, and perhaps most important: it's easy to tell if it's actually gold. A lot of things, if you want to test if it really is what people say it is, takes a lot of work OR takes destroying one of the thing in question. Gold, however, doesn't have that problem: if you hit it with a rock, you can deform it, and if you weigh an amount of gold and drop that in a full container of water, it will cause a known amount to spill - and it's VERY hard to duplicate BOTH of those features.\n\nEdit: Several people have responded adding that gold doesn't corrode. I didn't say that explicitly, but it was part of \"hard to destroy\" in my mind: many things that could have been used rot, corrode, or otherwise decay; which gold doesn't. However, specifically stating this is important, as it is one of relatively few metals that doesn't oxidize naturally."}
{"question": "(ELI5) What is it about Taiwan that makes it a good spot to produce computer chips?", "human_answer": "Semiconductor foundries are highly automated. The only workers they really have are highly educated and in general compensated very well. This was a huge deal a few years ago because China was trying to poach TSMC engineers to kickstart their domestic chip production. FYI that utterly failed as most of the startups collapsed and they're still stuck on tech that lags TSMC by at least 5 years (that's with taking into account SMIC's 7nm using DUV announcement).\n\nTSMC's prices are competitive because they are extremely focused on optimization of their production lines. The entire semiconductor industry is focused on optimization of the production lines, it's literally where all of their profits come from.\n\nCase in point, look at Intel's journey with 7nm on DUV lithography machines. DUV is capable of making 7nm and smaller chips, but the required steps to make the chips increases exponentially with the smaller nodes. Which means the risk of something going wrong increases exponentially, which craters yield quickly. EUV faces the same problem, but it resets the exponential growth. Intel started working on their 7nm when EUV was not ready yet while both Samsung and TSMC opted to wait for EUV before they really went after their 7nm and smaller. Intel constantly struggled with yield on DUV and they (relatively) recently gave up and finally bought EUV machines."}
{"question": "ELI5: How can a country afford to give billions of dollars in aid to another country if they themselves are in so much debt?", "human_answer": "Yeah the US Treasury for example isn't just like a giant checking account. It is more like a bazillion separate checking accounts and also a bunch of savings accounts and also a bunch of properties and other things.\n\nSo usually when loans are taken out by the government it goes to a specific checking account that is meant for a specific purpose. For example, the accounts meant to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were not funded by the taxpayers directly. Those accounts were almost entirely filled with funds that were \"borrowed\" from Japan and China and others who lent us money.\n\nSo the government has specific checking accounts funded by Congress with taxpayer money as well as properties (weapons, food/water/medicine relief stockpiles) that can only then be used to send to other countries as aid.\n\nSo even though we have a big loans out, that specific checking account meant for foreign aide has no risk of being used to pay those debts\n\nAlso no one is ever going to try to put the US in collections. But the way that debt works on that level is far too complicated to explain for ELI5.\n\nEdit: Oh yeah if you want to learn a bit how public debt is dealt with at the financial level here you go\n\nhttps://www.imf.org/-/media/Files/Publications/WP/2018/wp1874.ashx\n\nLmao have fun.

{"question": "ELI5: How does a poor country build an education system from scratch?", "human_answer": "Lots of countries are doing this, along the lines of u/Discoveryyellow's comment. \n\nFor any of it to work, it takes a government that is committed to education, and knows that the people want it. Then policies (based on evidence from similar countries) and budgets that make possible the changes needed. Then pilot projects to work out how to implement the policies in the context (including how to record data on how many kids are in school and learning). \n\nPilots are usually followed by initiatives to spread those changes across the country. These initiatives often involve instructions and money being sent to local governments and schools. \n\nThere will be some aid projects which fund the pilots, and other aid grants or loans which go into the government budget for the large scale stuff. To qualify for this aid, government also has to allocate more of its own funding to education.\n\nWhere corruption or war makes putting money into government accounts a bad idea, separate aid projects will control the money, directly training teachers etc. \n\nIf you want more details try Googling the Education For All journeys of Kenya and Tanzania, a while back. Or Sierra Leone, which is currently making good progress expanding education.

{"question": "ELI5: why it\u2019s common to have 87-octane gasoline in the US but it\u2019s almost always 95-octane in Europe?", "human_answer": "Chemical engineer here working in refining and specifically in gasoline production.\n\nSome of the other comments about Europe using Ron vs. Mon are correct, however, there is additional info:\n\nEuropean vehicles trend toward smaller displacement, higher compression ratios in their vehicles. Why? Because high compression ratios make a more efficient vehicle. What is a compression ratio? It is how much pressure you apply to the air/fuel mixture before setting off the spark.\n\nOk, so why is octane important here? All fluids heat up when compressed, if you heat up an air/fuel mixture beyond it's \"flash point\", it will auto ignite causing an explosion without the piston being in the right position for said explosion. This is what's called \"knock\" and is very hard on your engine.\n\nSo, higher octane means you can compress the air/fuel mixture more without knock, which leads to higher engine efficiency\n\nEdit: I want to make a comment about a common misconception here. A higher octane does not mean there is more energy per gallon of fuel in any meaningful way. The engine must be designed to fully utilize the properties of the higher octane fuel. If you just shove some high octane in your 87min Honda Accord, you won't get any better fuel economy. In some cases, because of the fuels resistance to ignition, you can actually end up causing some carbon deposits to occur in the engine."}
{"question": "eli5: How did we get from trading fur pelts and goods to using currency? I have never understood the logistics around how people adopted currency in those early days.", "human_answer": "Because it wasn\u2019t trade that led to the development of currency, but debt.   \n\nDebt preceded currency, and there are ancient records of debt being tracked on sticks or ledgers of goods (as in the Bible as an example). The first use of currency was to simplify logistics of kings and empires and debt, not barter and trade.   \n\nOne of the earliest cases was an emperor in china who issued currency so that families could \u201cbuy back\u201d their children that were traded into slavery. Another was for military empires that could pay soldiers and quartermasters in coin, then charge a tax (in the same coin) for the \u201cservices\u201d the empire offered in those lands. Those coins not only could be used to pay taxes, but then became a unit to use in trade as well.   \n\nTo over simplify - Rome pays its soldiers a coin a day. It gives its quartermasters thousands of coins. It charges every citizen a certain number of coins a month in taxes. As the army moves through territory, the quartermaster can buy supplies instead of having to forage for food and supplies. The citizens (or liberated people, conquered people) get coin for giving supplies, in excess of what they need for the taxes. The coin becomes useful for trade among the people as well since everyone has to pay the taxes anyway. \n\nCurrency exists to pay taxes, to settle debt with the governing power. It became useful in trade secondary to that."}
{"question": "ELI5: Why would increasing base interest rates combat high costs of living?", "human_answer": "Low interest loans allows for more money to flow through the economy. The more money there is in general, the easier it is to pay higher prices (inflation).\n\nLook at something like housing prices. The interest rate determines the monthly payment - the higher the interest rate, the bigger the monthly payment. For example, let's say you're taking out a $300,000 mortgage on a house. The monthly payment with a 2.5% interest rate ( roughly what it was at the beginning of the year) is about $1200. The monthly payment at 7.7% (what the average is right now) is $2140. So even though the price of the house hasn't changed, what people are paying for it has almost doubled - so they can afford less. In other words, there is less money available to a potential buyer.\n\nNow recognize that tons of things in our economy are paid for with loans, not just houses. If a business needs a loan to start, then suddenly it's a lot harder to start a healthy business. If a business needs a loan to buy some fancy new equipment, expand its inventory, hire some new people, or do something to expand the business, that becomes a harder to justify when paying off the debt becomes much harder. So the effect of raising interest rates is supposed to reduce the amount of money that is available in the economy - with less money going around, there is less demand for various products. Less demand means lower prices."}
{"question": "ELI5 why does Argentina have 100% inflation?", "human_answer": "Inflation is always a monetary process. Basically the sum of the following:  \n\n\n\\- Money printing machine turned up to 11 by a populist socialist government in order to keep subsidies and crazy expending in place\n\n\\- Argentina is one the most economically repressed countries of the \"civilized/western\" countries. Its easier to open a candy store in the middle of the fifth avenue in New York than in Buenos Aires. Bureaucracy, high taxes,  prices control, foreign currency exchange control and government intervention has basically deteriorated the expectative of organic economic growth in the country. Therefore their money is seen as a downtrend asset, so people in Argentina flee to another currencies in order to hedge against inflation. US Dollar, Euro, Chilean Peso or Bitcoin weakening even further the Argentinian peso.  \n\\- Argentina is know by it's rampant corruption and mismanagement of the country reserves. They have defaulted on their debt 12 times in a row. So nobody from the international investment community wants to touch Argentina. The country risk of Argentina is greater than Ukraine. This makes foreign currency even more scarce, driving upwards their price against ARS. The US dollar on the black market is like 3x more than the \"official government defined exchange rate\"  \n\\- And as last: there is a very low expectation that this context will change in the near future"}
{"question": "ELI5: Can someone explain to me the business model of musicians going on tour? is it to promote the album and get more people to listen on Spotify? or do they still go after album sales?", "human_answer": "There are world famous stadium filling musicians and those that aren't.\n\nIf you are a band with good skills and a following you can only play in your own backyard (IE: the clubs in your area) so often.   the blues bands playing local dive bars without cover charge probably can be in rotation once a month, but the acts getting $20 door fee can burn out their fan base doing so.  \n\nSo you have to hit the road and play the clubs.

{"question": "ELI5: why are energy prices rising in the UK, when their main sources is its own North Sea gas?", "human_answer": "When gas is extracted from the earth, you need somewhere to put it or you need to use it. \n\nThe UK North Gas fields are definitely a source of gas for the country, but the gas field is insufficient to meet all of its demand and Britain must therefore import gas from other places, like Norway, to make ends meet.\n\nMany countries without these Gas fields maintain large gas storage facilities. These facilities allow them to buy gas in the winter and use it in the summer. That way, it's much cheaper and can shield people from the high cost over winter.\n\nA few years ago it looked like gas was plentiful and the shift to renewables was going well. The UK decided to roll back it's already small storage facilities and it's now capable of storing less than 1 winter-month of Gas for the country.\n\nThis worked fine for some time, until everyone started panicking about gas capacity this year! Now everyone with storage capacity (like Germany) is filling up their tanks, investors are betting the prices will go up and driving it higher, and the UK has no storage to shield it from these large increases in price.\n\nEven if the UK stopped selling it's North Sea gas to other countries, the lack of storage capacity would mean the UK either needs to \"use it or lose it\". In any case, it doesn't produce enough to support its own needs anyway. Therefore, the UK is fully exposed to the global market price of natural gas."}

{"question": "ELI5: Can someone explain the purpose of digital convenience fees?", "human_answer": "Because it works. If you can find a way to draw people's attention with a lower price, they're more likely to purchase the item even if you then reveal additional fees. It's like getting your foot in the door. Think how over in the US they don't put tax on price tags, or how some places list the delivery charge as an additional fee afterward instead of integrating it (even when there aren't multiple delivery options to vary the price).\n\nIf the price is listed as a net cost then people will more likely think \"I can find cheaper\"/\"I can't afford that\" as an initial reaction, and their eyes move to the next product. If you put the prices as lower then you catch the customers' attention, and they're not seeing the higher/accurate number written down until committing to the purchase. The more time someone invests in considering the purchase, the harder it is to pull out, like how pushy salesmen annoy people but get results.\n\nPlus people don't like admitting to their mistakes if they can help it, so even if the customer didn't expect additional fees they might convince themselves unconsciously that they anticipated those fees and are therefore not deterred by them.

{"question": "ELI5: Why do we consider economics to be science?", "human_answer": "As others already noted, it is considered a social science. Not a natural science. \n\nThat said, in economics you can often do controlled experiments. You split groups of people, make one a control group, and do an economic intervention for the other. Universal basic incomes is an interesting idea for this. And relatively easier to control for. \n\nThings like the dictator game (more behavioral economics perhaps) and many similar experiments are controlled. But it\u2019s fair to say these things are controlled experiments. Not ideal, not perfect, but they are attempts at such. \n\nEven better, you find a lot of natural experiments. The usa is particularly good for that as different states adopt economic policies (and other policies) in different years. Which helps to tease out the causality more so than in other areas. Abortion is a controversial one as different states legalised abortion in different years and thus you can pull out the economic (and other social) impact of this. \n\nComparing countries that are roughly similar does the same thing. Again more behavioral economics, but comparing the organ donation of Austria and Germany (as they\u2019re culturally similar) helps keep things \u2018all other things being equal\u2019. \n\nIn short, you can do many controlled experiments. It may be tougher to pull out other factors (tho many complex statistically regression techniques exist to do so), there is certainly a science to this."}
