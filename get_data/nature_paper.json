A key next step in assessing the habitability of these ocean worlds is to determine whether life\u2019s elemental and energy requirements are also met. Phosphorus is required by all known life and is often limited to biological productivity in Earth\u2019s oceans. This raises the possibility that its availability may limit the abundance or productivity of Earth-like life on ocean worlds. To address this potential problem, here we calculate the equilibrium dissolved phosphate concentrations associated with the reaction of water and rocks\u2014a key driver of ocean chemical evolution\u2014across a broad range of compositional inputs and reaction conditions. Equilibrium dissolved phosphate concentrations range from 10\u221211 to 10\u22121\u2009mol/kg across the full range of carbonaceous chondrite compositions and reaction conditions considered, but are generally > 10\u22125\u2009mol/kg for most plausible scenarios. Relative to the phosphate requirements and uptake kinetics of microorganisms in Earth\u2019s oceans, such concentrations would be sufficient to support initially rapid cell growth and construction of global ocean cell populations larger than those observed in Earth\u2019s deep oceans."}, {"title": "Incorporating human dimensions is associated with better wildlife translocation outcomes", "abstract": "Wildlife translocations are increasingly used to combat declining biodiversity worldwide. Successful translocation often hinges on coexistence between humans and wildlife, yet not all translocation efforts explicitly include human dimensions (e.g., economic incentives, education programs, and conflict reduction assistance). To evaluate the prevalence and associated outcomes of including human dimensions as objectives when planning translocations, we analyze 305 case studies from the IUCN\u2019s Global Re-Introduction Perspectives Series. We find that fewer than half of all projects included human dimension objectives (42%), but that projects including human dimension objectives were associated with improved wildlife population outcomes (i.e., higher probability of survival, reproduction, or population growth). Translocation efforts were more likely to include human dimension objectives if they involved mammals, species with a history of local human conflict, and local stakeholders. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating objectives related to human dimensions in translocation planning efforts to improve conservation success."}, {"title": "Dueling dynamics of low-angle normal fault rupture with splay faulting and off-fault damage", "abstract": "Despite a lack of modern large earthquakes on shallowly dipping normal faults, Holocene Mw\u2009>\u20097 low-angle normal fault (LANF; dip<30\u00b0) ruptures are preserved paleoseismically and inferred from historical earthquake and tsunami accounts. Even in well-recorded megathrust earthquakes, the effects of non-linear off-fault plasticity and dynamically reactivated splay faults on shallow deformation and surface displacements, and thus hazard, remain elusive. We develop data-constrained 3D dynamic rupture models of the active Mai\u2019iu LANF that highlight how multiple dynamic shallow deformation mechanisms compete during large LANF earthquakes. We show that shallowly-dipping synthetic splays host more coseismic slip and limit shallow LANF rupture more than steeper antithetic splays. Inelastic hanging-wall yielding localizes into subplanar shear bands indicative of newly initiated splay faults, most prominently above LANFs with thick sedimentary basins. Dynamic splay faulting and sediment failure limit shallow LANF rupture, modulating coseismic subsidence patterns, near-shore slip velocities, and the seismic and tsunami hazards posed by LANF earthquakes."}, {"title": "Species invasiveness and community invasibility of North American freshwater fish fauna revealed via trait-based analysis", "abstract": "While biological invasions are recognized as a major threat to global biodiversity, determining non-native species\u2019 abilities to establish in new areas (species invasiveness) and the vulnerability of those areas to invasions (community invasibility) is challenging. Here, we use trait-based analysis to profile invasive species and quantify the community invasibility for >1,800 North American freshwater fish communities. We show that, in addition to effects attributed to propagule pressure caused by human intervention, species with higher fecundity, longer lifespan and larger size tend to be more invasive. Community invasibility peaks when the functional distance among native species was high, leaving unoccupied functional space for the establishment of potential invaders. Our findings illustrate how the functional traits of non-native species determining their invasiveness, and the functional characteristics of the invaded community determining its invasibility, may be identified. Considering those two determinants together will enable better predictions of invasions."}, {"title": "Trends and variability in the Southern Annular Mode over the Common Era", "abstract": "The Southern Annular Mode (SAM) is the leading mode of atmospheric variability in the extratropical Southern Hemisphere and has wide ranging effects on ecosystems and societies. Despite the SAM\u2019s importance, paleoclimate reconstructions disagree on its variability and trends over the Common Era, which may be linked to variability in SAM teleconnections and the influence of specific proxies. Here, we use data assimilation with a multi-model prior to reconstruct the SAM over the last 2000 years using temperature and drought-sensitive climate proxies. Our method does not assume a stationary relationship between the SAM and the proxy records and allows us to identify critical paleoclimate records and quantify reconstruction uncertainty through time. We find no evidence for a forced response in SAM variability prior to the 20th century. We do find the modern positive trend falls outside the 2\u03c3 range of the prior 2000 years at multidecadal time scales, supporting the inference that the SAM\u2019s positive trend over the last several decades is a response to anthropogenic climate change."}, {"title": "The potential for coral reef restoration to mitigate coastal flooding as sea levels rise", "abstract": "The ability of reefs to protect coastlines from storm-driven flooding hinges on their capacity to keep pace with sea-level rise.

We combined coral-growth measurements and carbonate-budget assessments of reef-accretion potential at Buck Island Reef, U.S. Virgin Islands, with hydrodynamic modeling to quantify future coastal flooding under various coral-restoration, sea-level rise, and storm scenarios. Our results provide guidance on how restoration of Acropora palmata, if successful, could mitigate the most extreme impacts of coastal flooding by reversing projected trajectories of reef erosion and allowing reefs to keep pace with the ~0.5\u2009m of sea-level rise expected by 2100 with moderate carbon-emissions reductions.

However, mobility restrictions during the pandemic have forced people to reduce urban encounters, raising questions about the social implications of behavioral changes. In this paper, we study how individual income diversity of urban encounters changed during the pandemic, using a large-scale, privacy-enhanced mobility dataset of more than one million anonymized mobile phone users in Boston, Dallas, Los Angeles, and Seattle, across three years spanning before and during the pandemic. We find that the diversity of urban encounters has substantially decreased (by 15% to 30%) during the pandemic and has persisted through late 2021, even though aggregated mobility metrics have recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Counterfactual analyses show that behavioral changes including lower willingness to explore new places further decreased the diversity of encounters in the long term. Our findings provide implications for managing the trade-off between the stringency of COVID-19 policies and the diversity of urban encounters as we move beyond the pandemic."}, {"title": "Contrasting geochemical and fungal controls on decomposition of lignin and soil carbon at continental scale", "abstract": "Lignin is an abundant and complex plant polymer that may limit litter decomposition, yet lignin is sometimes a minor constituent of soil organic carbon (SOC). Accounting for diversity in soil characteristics might reconcile this apparent contradiction. Tracking decomposition of a lignin/litter mixture and SOC across different North American mineral soils using lab and field incubations, here we show that cumulative lignin decomposition varies 18-fold among soils and is strongly correlated with bulk litter decomposition, but not SOC decomposition. Climate legacy predicts decomposition in the lab, and impacts of nitrogen availability are minor compared with geochemical and microbial properties. Lignin decomposition increases with some metals and fungal taxa, whereas SOC decomposition decreases with metals and is weakly related with fungi. Decoupling of lignin and SOC decomposition and their contrasting biogeochemical drivers indicate that lignin is not necessarily a bottleneck for SOC decomposition and can explain variable contributions of lignin to SOC among ecosystems."}, {"title": "Atlantic water intrusion triggers rapid retreat and regime change at previously stable Greenland glacier", "abstract": "Ice discharge from Greenland\u2019s marine-terminating glaciers contributes to half of all mass loss from the ice sheet, with numerous mechanisms proposed to explain their retreat.

This rate of change is unprecedented amongst Greenland\u2019s glaciers and now places Steenstrup in the top 10% of glaciers by contribution to ice-sheet-wide discharge. In contrast to expected behaviour from a shallow, grounded tidewater glacier, Steenstrup was insensitive to high surface temperatures that destabilised many regional glaciers in 2016, appearing instead to respond to a >2\u2009\u00b0C anomaly in deeper Atlantic water (AW) in 2018.

Microbial biomass is usually assumed to grow by cellular replication, despite microorganisms\u2019 capacity to increase biomass by synthesizing storage compounds. Resource investment in storage allows microbes to decouple their metabolic activity from immediate resource supply, supporting more diverse microbial responses to environmental changes. Here we show that microbial C storage in the form of triacylglycerides (TAGs) and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) contributes significantly to the formation of new biomass, i.e. growth, under contrasting conditions of C availability and complementary nutrient supply in soil. Together these compounds can comprise a C pool 0.19\u2009\u00b1\u20090.03 to 0.46\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08 times as large as extractable soil microbial biomass and reveal up to 279\u2009\u00b1\u200972% more biomass growth than observed by a DNA-based method alone.

We modeled the associations between all storms in FL from 1999 to 2016 and over 3.5 million Medicare hospitalizations for respiratory (RD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). We estimated the relative risk (RR), comparing hospitalizations during TC-periods (2 days before to 7 days after) to matched non-TC-periods. We then separately modeled the associations in relation to individual and community characteristics. TCs were associated with elevated risk of RD hospitalizations (RR: 4.37, 95% CI: 3.08, 6.19), but not CVD (RR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.87, 1.24). There was limited evidence of modification by individual characteristics (age, sex, or Medicaid eligibility); however, risks were elevated in communities with higher poverty or lower homeownership (for CVD hospitalizations) and in denser or more urban communities (for RD hospitalizations).

Kelp forests are diminishing in many regions worldwide, and efforts to manage these ecosystems are hindered without accurate estimates of the value of the services that kelp forests provide to human societies. Here, we present a global estimate of the ecological and economic potential of three key ecosystem services - fisheries production, nutrient cycling, and carbon removal provided by six major forest forming kelp genera (Ecklonia, Laminaria, Lessonia, Macrocystis, Nereocystis, and Saccharina). Each of these genera creates a potential value of between $64,400 and $147,100/hectare each year. Collectively, they generate between $465 and $562 billion/year worldwide, with an average of $500 billion. These values are primarily driven by fisheries production (mean $29,900, 904 Kg/Ha/year) and nitrogen removal ($73,800, 657 Kg N/Ha/year), though kelp forests are also estimated to sequester 4.91 megatons of carbon from the atmosphere/year highlighting their potential as blue carbon systems for climate change mitigation.

Therefore, a better understanding of Antarctic ice-sheet dynamics during this interval would provide valuable insights for projecting sea-level change in future warming scenarios. Here we present a high-resolution record constraining ice-sheet changes in the Wilkes Subglacial Basin (WSB) of East Antarctica during the LIG, based on analysis of sediment provenance and an ice melt proxy in a marine sediment core retrieved from the Wilkes Land margin. Our sedimentary records, together with existing ice-core records, reveal dynamic fluctuations of the ice sheet in the WSB, with thinning, melting, and potentially retreat leading to ice loss during both early and late stages of the LIG. We suggest that such changes along the East Antarctic Ice Sheet margin may have contributed to fluctuating global sea levels during the LIG."}, {"title": "Stomatal responses of terrestrial plants to global change", "abstract": "Quantifying the stomatal responses of plants to global change factors is crucial for modeling terrestrial carbon and water cycles.

These responses vary with treatment magnitude, plant attributes (ambient gs, vegetation biomes, and plant functional types), and climate. All two-factor combinations (except warming + N deposition) significantly reduce gs, and their individual effects are commonly additive but tend to be antagonistic as the effect sizes increased. We further show that rising CO2 and warming would dominate the future change of plant gs across biomes. The results of our meta-analysis provide a foundation for understanding and predicting plant gs across biomes and guiding manipulative experiment designs in a real world where global change factors do not occur in isolation."}, {"title": "Global patterns and edaphic-climatic controls of soil carbon decomposition kinetics predicted from incubation experiments", "abstract": "Knowledge about global patterns of the decomposition kinetics of distinct soil organic matter (SOM) pools is crucial to robust estimates of land-atmosphere carbon fluxes under climate change.

Here, we compile a comprehensive set of edaphic-climatic and SOM decomposition data from published incubation experiments and employ machine-learning techniques to develop models capable of predicting the expected sizes and kref of multiple SOM pools (fast, slow, and passive). We show that soil texture dominates the turnover of the fast pools, whereas pH predominantly regulates passive SOM decomposition. This suggests that pH-sensitive bacterial decomposers might have larger effects on stable SOM decomposition than previously believed. Using these predictive models, we provide a 1-km resolution global-scale dataset of the sizes and kref of these SOM pools, which may improve global biogeochemical model parameterization and predictions."}, {"title": "Advancing research on compound weather and climate events via large ensemble model simulations", "abstract": "Societally relevant weather impacts typically result from compound events, which are rare combinations of weather and climate drivers.

Analyses of polyaromatic hydrocarbons at sampling intervals representing 1.5\u20136.3\u2009yr reveal recurrent pulses of wildfires in the terrestrial realm. Massive input pulses of soil-derived organic matter and clastic materials into the oceans are indicated by patterns of C2-dibenzofuran, C30 hopane and aluminum.

Here we study different OM fractions in Siberian permafrost deposited during colder and warmer periods of the past 55,000 years. Among known stabilization mechanisms, the occlusion of OM in aggregates is of minor importance, while 33-74% of the organic carbon is associated with small, <6.3\u2009\u00b5m mineral particles. Preservation of carbon in mineral-associated OM is enhanced by reactive iron minerals particularly during cold and dry climate, reflected by low microbial CO2 production in incubation experiments.

In this analysis, the GI lies far inboard the Jurassic Patagonian-Antarctic Peninsula active margin. This was formerly attributed to a large-scale flat subduction event in the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic. We propose that during this flat slab stage, the subduction-modified mantle areas beneath the Mesozoic active margin and surrounding sutures zones may have been bulldozed inland by >2280 km. After the demise of the flat slab, this mantle anomaly remained near-stationary and was sampled by the Karoo mantle plume 183 Million years (Myr) ago and again since 55 Myr ago by the SASWIR.

It is universal in field catalogs across fault types and tectonic/induced settings, while laboratory results are unaffected by loading protocol or rock types and show temporal stability. The absence of clustering can be imposed by a global tensile stress, although clustering still occurs when isolating to triggered event pairs or spatial patches where shear stress dominates.

Through a combination of theory, analysis of deposits and experiments of natural mixtures, we show that rapid changes of the grain-size distribution transported in BAFs result in the reduction of pore volume (compaction) within the first kilometres of their runout. We then use a multiphase flow model to show how the compressibility of granular mixtures leads to fragmentation-induced fluidisation (FIF) and excess pore-fluid pressure in BAFs. This process dominates the first ~2\u2009km of their runout, where the effective friction coefficient is progressively reduced. Beyond that distance, transport is modulated by diffusion of the excess pore pressure.

We show that this acceleration is primarily induced by an ocean dynamic signal exceeding the externally forced response from historical climate model simulations. However, when the simulated forced response is removed from observations, the residuals are neither historically unprecedented nor inconsistent with internal variability in simulations. A large fraction of the residuals is consistent with wind driven Rossby waves in the tropical North Atlantic. This indicates that this ongoing acceleration represents the compounding effects of external forcing and internal climate variability."}, {"title": "Organic matter degradation causes enrichment of organic pollutants in hadal sediments", "abstract": "Burial of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in deep-sea sediments contributes to 60% of their historical emissions. Yet, empirical data on their occurrence in the deep-ocean is scarce. Estimates of the deep-ocean POP sink are therefore uncertain. Hadal trenches, representing the deepest part of the ocean, are hotspots for organic carbon burial and decomposition. POPs favorably partition to organic carbon, making trenches likely significant sinks for contaminants. Here we show that PCBs occur in both hadal (7720\u20138085\u2009m) and non-hadal (2560\u20134050\u2009m) sediment in the Atacama Trench. PCB concentrations normalized to sediment dry weight were similar across sites while those normalized to sediment organic carbon increased exponentially as the inert organic carbon fraction of the sediment increased in degraded hadal sediments. We suggest that the unique deposition dynamics and elevated turnover of organic carbon in hadal trenches increase POP concentrations in the deepest places on Earth."}, {"title": "Fast and slow intraplate ruptures during the 19 October 2020 magnitude 7.6 Shumagin earthquake", "abstract": "Strong tsunami excitation from slow rupture of shallow subduction zone faults is recognized as a key concern for tsunami hazard assessment. Three months after the 22 July 2020 magnitude 7.8 thrust earthquake struck the plate boundary below the Shumagin Islands, Alaska, a magnitude 7.6 aftershock ruptured with complex intraplate faulting. Despite the smaller size and predominantly strike-slip faulting mechanism inferred from seismic waves for the aftershock, it generated much larger tsunami waves than the mainshock. Here we show through detailed analysis of seismic, geodetic, and tsunami observations of the aftershock that the event implicated unprecedented source complexity, involving weakly tsunamigenic fast rupture of two intraplate faults located below and most likely above the plate boundary, along with induced strongly tsunamigenic slow thrust slip on a third fault near the shelf break likely striking nearly perpendicular to the trench. The thrust slip took over 5\u2009min, giving no clear expression in seismic or geodetic observations while producing the sizeable far-field tsunami."}, {"title": "Increasing deep-water overflow from the Pacific into the South China Sea revealed by mooring observations", "abstract": "Cold and dense water from the North Pacific Ocean that spills through the Luzon Strait, the only deep conduit between the South China Sea (SCS) and the Pacific Ocean, renews deep-water mass, modulates hydrographic and biogeochemical cycles, and drives abyssal and overturning circulations in the SCS. The variability of this key oceanic process, however, has been poorly studied, mainly due to a lack of sustained observations. A comprehensive observational program that started in 2009 has provided 12 years of continuous time series of velocity and volume transport within the Luzon Strait.

Little is known about microbial sulfur cycling in circumneutral pH mine tailing impoundment waters. Here we investigate biological sulfur oxidation over four years in a mine tailings impoundment water cap, integrating aqueous sulfur geochemistry, genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics. The microbial community is consistently dominated by neutrophilic, chemolithoautotrophic SOB (relative abundances of ~76% in 2015, ~55% in 2016/2017 and ~60% in 2018). Results reveal two SOB strategies alternately dominate across the four years, influencing acid generation and sulfur speciation. Under oxic conditions, novel Halothiobacillus drive lower pH conditions (as low as 4.3) and lower [S2O32\u2212] via the complete Sox pathway coupled to O2. Under anoxic conditions, Thiobacillus spp. dominate in activity, via the incomplete Sox and rDSR pathways coupled to NO3\u2212, resulting in higher [S2O32\u2212] and no net significant acidity generation. This study provides genomic evidence explaining acidity generation and thiosulfate accumulation patterns in a circumneutral mine tailing impoundment and has significant environmental applications in preventing the discharge of sulfur compounds that can impact downstream environments. These insights illuminate opportunities for in situ biotreatment of reduced sulfur compounds and prediction of acidification events using gene-based monitoring and in situ RNA detection."}, {"title": "Middle Pleistocene re-organization of Australian Monsoon", "abstract": "The sensitivity of the Australian Monsoon to changing climate boundary conditions remains controversial due to limited understanding of forcing processes and past variability. Here, we reconstruct austral summer monsoonal discharge and wind-driven winter productivity across the Middle Pleistocene Transition (MPT) in a sediment sequence drilled off NW Australia. We show that monsoonal precipitation and runoff primarily responded to precessional insolation forcing until ~0.95\u2009Ma, but exhibited heightened sensitivity to ice volume and pCO2 related feedbacks following intensification of glacial-interglacial cycles. Our records further suggest that summer monsoon variability at the precessional band was closely tied to the thermal evolution of the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and strength of the Walker circulation over the past ~1.6\u2009Myr. By contrast, productivity proxy records consistently tracked glacial-interglacial variability, reflecting changing rhythms in polar ice fluctuations and Hadley circulation strength. We conclude that the Australian Monsoon underwent a major re-organization across the MPT and that extratropical feedbacks were instrumental in driving short- and long-term variability."}, {"title": "New constraints on Cenozoic subduction between India and Tibet", "abstract": "The type of lithosphere subducted between India and Tibet since the Paleocene remains controversial; it has been suggested to be either entirely continental, oceanic, or a mixture of the two. As the subduction history of this lost lithosphere strongly shaped Tibetan intraplate tectonism, we attempt to further constrain its nature and density structure with numerical models that aim to reproduce the observed history of magmatism and crustal thickening in addition to present-day plateau properties between 83\u00b0E and 88\u00b0E. By matching time-evolving geological patterns, here we show that Tibetan tectonism away from the Himalayan syntaxis is consistent with the initial indentation of a craton-like terrane at 55\u2009\u00b1\u20095\u2009Ma, followed by a buoyant tectonic plate with a thin crust, e.g., a broad continental margin (Himalandia). This new geodynamic scenario can explain the seemingly contradictory observations that had led to competing hypotheses like the subduction of Greater India versus largely oceanic subduction prior to Indian indentation."}, {"title": "Year-round utilization of sea ice-associated carbon in Arctic ecosystems", "abstract": "Sea ice primary production is considered a valuable energy source for Arctic marine food webs, yet the extent remains unclear through existing methods. Here we quantify ice algal carbon signatures using unique lipid biomarkers in over 2300 samples from 155 species including invertebrates, fish, seabirds, and marine mammals collected across the Arctic shelves. Ice algal carbon signatures were present within 96% of the organisms investigated, collected year-round from January to December, suggesting continuous utilization of this resource despite its lower proportion to pelagic production. These results emphasize the importance of benthic retention of ice algal carbon that is available to consumers year-round. Finally, we suggest that shifts in the phenology, distribution and biomass of sea ice primary production anticipated with declining seasonal sea ice will disrupt sympagic-pelagic-benthic coupling and consequently the structure and the functioning of the food web which is critical for Indigenous Peoples, commercial fisheries, and global biodiversity."}, {"title": "Electrified hydrocarbon-to-oxygenates coupled to hydrogen evolution for efficient greenhouse gas mitigation", "abstract": "Chemicals manufacture is among the top greenhouse gas contributors. More than half of the associated emissions are attributable to the sum of ammonia plus oxygenates such as methanol, ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid. Here we explore the impact of electrolyzer systems that couple electrically-powered anodic hydrocarbon-to-oxygenate conversion with cathodic H2 evolution reaction from water. We find that, once anodic hydrocarbon-to-oxygenate conversion is developed with high selectivities, greenhouse gas emissions associated with fossil-based NH3 and oxygenates manufacture can be reduced by up to 88%. We report that low-carbon electricity is not mandatory to enable a net reduction in greenhouse gas emissions: global chemical industry emissions can be reduced by up to 39% even with electricity having the carbon footprint per MWh available in the United States or China today. We conclude with considerations and recommendations for researchers who wish to embark on this research direction."}, {"title": "Early indicators of tidal ecosystem shifts in estuaries", "abstract": "Forecasting transitions between tidal ecosystem states, such as between bare tidal flats and vegetated marshes, is crucial because it may imply the irreversible loss of valuable ecosystem services. In this study, we combine geospatial analyses of three European estuaries with a simple numerical model to demonstrate that the development of micro-topographic patterning on tidal flats is an early indicator of marsh establishment. We first show that the development of micro-topographic patterns precedes vegetation establishment, and that patterns tend to form only on tidal flats with a slope of <0.3 degrees. Numerical modelling then provides an explanation for the formation of micro-topography due to the natural concentration of draining surface water over very gentle slopes. We find this early indicator to be robust across three estuaries where anthropogenic deepening and narrowing has occurred in recent decades, which may suggest its broader applicability to other estuaries with similar morphological management."}, {"title": "Carbon-sink potential of continuous alfalfa agriculture lowered by short-term nitrous oxide emission events", "abstract": "Alfalfa is the most widely grown forage crop worldwide and is thought to be a significant carbon sink due to high productivity, extensive root systems, and nitrogen-fixation. However, these conditions may increase nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions thus lowering the climate change mitigation potential. We used a suite of long-term automated instrumentation and satellite imagery to quantify patterns and drivers of greenhouse gas fluxes in a continuous alfalfa agroecosystem in California. We show that this continuous alfalfa system was a large N2O source (624\u2009\u00b1\u200928\u2009mg N2O m2 y\u22121), offsetting the ecosystem carbon (carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4)) sink by up to 14% annually. Short-term N2O emissions events (i.e., hot moments) accounted for \u22641% of measurements but up to 57% of annual emissions. Seasonal and daily trends in rainfall and irrigation were the primary drivers of hot moments of N2O emissions. Significant coherence between satellite-derived photosynthetic activity and N2O fluxes suggested plant activity was an important driver of background emissions. Combined data show annual N2O emissions can significantly lower the carbon-sink potential of continuous alfalfa agriculture."}, {"title": "Mid-latitudinal habitable environment for marine eukaryotes during the waning stage of the Marinoan snowball glaciation", "abstract": "During the Marinoan Ice Age (ca. 654\u2013635\u2009Ma), one of the \u2018Snowball Earth\u2019 events in the Cryogenian Period, continental icesheets reached the tropical oceans. Oceanic refugia must have existed for aerobic marine eukaryotes to survive this event, as evidenced by benthic phototrophic macroalgae of the Songluo Biota preserved in black shales interbedded with glacial diamictites of the late Cryogenian Nantuo Formation in South China. However, the environmental conditions that allowed these organisms to thrive are poorly known. Here, we report carbon-nitrogen-iron geochemical data from the fossiliferous black shales and adjacent diamictites of the Nantuo Formation. Iron-speciation data document dysoxic-anoxic conditions in bottom waters, whereas nitrogen isotopes record aerobic nitrogen cycling perhaps in surface waters. These findings indicate that habitable open-ocean conditions were more extensive than previously thought, extending into mid-latitude coastal oceans and providing refugia for eukaryotic organisms during the waning stage of the Marinoan Ice Age."}, {"title": "Sterol methyltransferases in uncultured bacteria complicate eukaryotic biomarker interpretations", "abstract": "Sterane molecular fossils are broadly interpreted as eukaryotic biomarkers, although diverse bacteria also produce sterols. Steranes with side-chain methylations can act as more specific biomarkers if their sterol precursors are limited to particular eukaryotes and are absent in bacteria. One such sterane, 24-isopropylcholestane, has been attributed to demosponges and potentially represents the earliest evidence for animals on Earth, but enzymes that methylate sterols to give the 24-isopropyl side-chain remain undiscovered. Here, we show that sterol methyltransferases from both sponges and yet-uncultured bacteria function in vitro and identify three methyltransferases from symbiotic bacteria each capable of sequential methylations resulting in the 24-isopropyl sterol side-chain. We demonstrate that bacteria have the genomic capacity to synthesize side-chain alkylated sterols, and that bacterial symbionts may contribute to 24-isopropyl sterol biosynthesis in demosponges. Together, our results suggest bacteria should not be dismissed as potential contributing sources of side-chain alkylated sterane biomarkers in the rock record."}, {"title": "Increased warm water intrusions could cause mass loss in East Antarctica during the next 200 years", "abstract": "The East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) is currently surrounded by relatively cool water, but climatic shifts have the potential to increase basal melting via intrusions of warm modified Circumpolar Deep Water (mCDW) onto the continental shelf. Here we use an ice sheet model to show that under the current ocean regime, with only limited intrusions of mCDW, the EAIS will likely gain mass over the next 200 years due to the increased precipitation from a warming atmosphere outweighing increased ice discharge due to ice-shelf melting. However, if the ocean regime were to become dominated by greater mCDW intrusions, the EAIS would have a negative mass balance, contributing up to 48 mm of SLE over this time period. Our modelling finds George V Land to be particularly at risk to increased ocean induced melting. With warmer oceans, we also find that a mid range RCP4.5 emissions scenario is likely to result in a more negative mass balance than a high RCP8.5 emissions scenario, as the relative difference between increased precipitation due to a warming atmosphere and increased ice discharge due to a warming ocean is more negative in the mid range RCP4.5 emission scenario."}, {"title": "Electron transfer rules of minerals under pressure informed by machine learning", "abstract": "Electron transfer is the most elementary process in nature, but the existing electron transfer rules are seldom applied to high-pressure situations, such as in the deep Earth. Here we show a deep learning model to obtain the electronegativity of 96 elements under arbitrary pressure, and a regressed unified formula to quantify its relationship with pressure and electronic configuration. The relative work function of minerals is further predicted by electronegativity, presenting a decreasing trend with pressure because of pressure-induced electron delocalization. Using the work function as the case study of electronegativity, it reveals that\u00a0the driving force behind directional electron transfer results from the enlarged work function difference between compounds with pressure. This well explains the deep high-conductivity anomalies, and helps discover the redox reactivity between widespread Fe(II)-bearing minerals and water during ongoing subduction.

But little is known about the underlying physical drivers. Here, we are using a suite of large ensemble simulations of the Community Earth System Model 2 to elucidate the causes of non-uniform Indian Ocean warming. Strong negative air-sea interactions in the Eastern Indian Ocean are responsible for a future weakening of the zonal sea surface temperature gradient, resulting in a slowdown of the Indian Ocean Walker circulation and the generation of southeasterly wind anomalies over the AS. These contribute to anomalous northward ocean heat transport, reduced evaporative cooling, a weakening in upper ocean vertical mixing and an enhanced AS future warming. In contrast, the projected warming in the SEIO is related to a reduction of low-cloud cover and an associated increase in shortwave radiation. Therefore, the regional character of air-sea interactions plays a key role in promoting future large-scale tropical atmospheric circulation anomalies with implications for society and ecosystems far outside the Indian Ocean realm."}, {"title": "Elevation-dependent intensification of fire danger in the western United States", "abstract": "Studies have identified elevation-dependent warming trends, but investigations of such trends in fire danger are absent in the literature. Here, we demonstrate that while there have been widespread increases in fire danger across the mountainous western US from 1979 to 2020, trends were most acute at high-elevation regions above 3000\u2009m. The greatest increase in the number of days conducive to large fires occurred at 2500\u20133000\u2009m, adding 63 critical fire danger days between 1979 and 2020. This includes 22 critical fire danger days occurring outside the warm season (May\u2013September). Furthermore, our findings indicate increased elevational synchronization of fire danger in western US mountains, which can facilitate increased geographic opportunities for ignitions and fire spread that further complicate fire management operations. We hypothesize that several physical mechanisms underpinned the observed trends, including elevationally disparate impacts of earlier snowmelt, intensified land-atmosphere feedbacks, irrigation, and aerosols, in addition to widespread warming/drying."}, {"title": "Widespread detection of chlorine oxyacids in the Arctic atmosphere", "abstract": "Chlorine radicals are strong atmospheric oxidants known to play an important role in the depletion of surface ozone and the degradation of methane in the Arctic troposphere. Initial oxidation processes of chlorine produce chlorine oxides, and it has been speculated that the final oxidation steps lead to the formation of chloric (HClO3) and perchloric (HClO4) acids, although these two species have not been detected in the atmosphere. Here, we present atmospheric observations of gas-phase HClO3 and HClO4. Significant levels of HClO3 were observed during springtime at Greenland (Villum Research Station), Ny-\u00c5lesund research station and over the central Arctic Ocean, on-board research vessel Polarstern during the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of the Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) campaign, with estimated concentrations up to 7\u2009\u00d7\u2009106 molecule cm\u22123. The increase in HClO3, concomitantly with that in HClO4, was linked to the increase in bromine levels. These observations indicated that bromine chemistry enhances the formation of OClO, which is subsequently oxidized into HClO3 and HClO4 by hydroxyl radicals. HClO3 and HClO4 are not photoactive and therefore their loss through heterogeneous uptake on aerosol and snow surfaces can function as a previously missing atmospheric sink for reactive chlorine, thereby reducing the chlorine-driven oxidation capacity in the Arctic boundary layer. Our study reveals additional chlorine species in the atmosphere, providing further insights into atmospheric chlorine cycling in the polar environment."}, {"title": "Widespread natural methane and oil leakage from sub-marine Arctic reservoirs", "abstract": "Parceling the anthropogenic and natural (geological) sources of fossil methane in the atmosphere remains problematic due to a lack of distinctive chemical markers for their discrimination. In this light, understanding the distribution and contribution of potential geological methane sources is important. Here we present empirical observations of hitherto undocumented, widespread and extensive methane and oil release from geological reservoirs to the Arctic Ocean. Methane fluxes from >7000 seeps significantly deplete in seawater, but nevertheless reach the sea surface and may transfer to the air. Oil slick emission spots and gas ebullition are persistent across multi-year observations and correlate to formerly glaciated geological structures, which have experienced km-scale glacial erosion that has left hydrocarbon reservoirs partially uncapped since the last deglaciation ~15,000 years ago. Such persistent, geologically controlled, natural hydrocarbon release may be characteristic of formerly glaciated hydrocarbon-bearing basins which are common across polar continental shelves, and could represent an underestimated source of natural fossil methane within the global carbon cycle."}, {"title": "The color of environmental noise in river networks", "abstract": "Despite its far-reaching implications for conservation and natural resource management, little is known about the color of environmental noise, or the structure of temporal autocorrelation in random environmental variation, in streams and rivers.

We find that daily and annual flows are dominated by red and white spectra respectively, and spatial variation in noise color is explained by a combination of geographic, hydroclimatic, and anthropogenic variables. Noise color at the daily scale is influenced by stream network position, and land use and water management explain around one third of the spatial variation in noise color irrespective of the timescale considered. Our results highlight the peculiarities of environmental variation regimes in riverine systems, and reveal a strong human fingerprint on the stochastic patterns of streamflow variation in river networks."}, {"title": "Seismic evidence for a 1000 km mantle discontinuity under the Pacific", "abstract": "Seismic discontinuities in the mantle are indicators of its thermo-chemical state and offer clues to its dynamics.

Here, we show how to use a wave-equation-based imaging method, reverse-time migration of precursors to surface-reflected seismic body waves, to\u00a0uncover both mantle transition zone and mid-mantle discontinuities, and interpret their physical nature. We observe a thinned mantle transition zone southeast of Hawaii, and a reduction in impedance contrast around 410\u2009km depth in the same area, suggesting a hotter-than-average mantle in the region.

This deep discontinuity exhibits strong topography and generates reflections with polarity opposite to those originating at the 660\u2009km discontinuity, implying an impedance reversal near 1000\u2009km. We link this mid-mantle discontinuity to the upper reaches of deflected mantle plumes upwelling in the region.

Since IgE exerts potent immune-activating functions in tissues, we engineer a monoclonal IgE antibody with human constant domains recognizing CSPG4 to target melanoma. CSPG4 IgE binds to human melanomas including metastases, mediates tumoricidal antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and stimulates human IgE Fc-receptor-expressing monocytes towards pro-inflammatory phenotypes.\u00a0IgE demonstrates anti-tumor activity in human melanoma xenograft models engrafted with human effector cells and is associated with enhanced macrophage infiltration, enriched monocyte and macrophage gene signatures and pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in the tumor microenvironment.

Machine learning may help overcome the challenges of diagnosing SARDs and inform clinical decision-making. Here, we developed and tested a machine learning model to identify patients who should receive rheumatological evaluation for SARDs using longitudinal electronic health records of 161,584 individuals from two institutions. The model demonstrated high performance for predicting cases of autoantibody-tested individuals in a validation set, an external test set, and an independent cohort with a broader case definition. This approach identified more individuals for autoantibody testing compared with current clinical standards and a greater proportion of autoantibody carriers among those tested. Diagnoses of SARDs and other autoimmune conditions increased with higher model probabilities. The model detected a need for autoantibody testing and rheumatology encounters up to five years before the test date and assessment date, respectively. Altogether, these findings illustrate that the clinical manifestations of a diverse array of autoimmune conditions are detectable in electronic health records using machine learning, which may help systematize and accelerate autoimmune testing."}, {"title": "Isthmin-1 (Ism1) modulates renal branching morphogenesis and mesenchyme condensation during early kidney development", "abstract": "The outgrowth of epithelial bud followed by reiterated bifurcations during renal development is driven by the ligand-receptor interactions between the epithelium and the surrounding mesenchyme.

Mice deficient for Ism1 exhibit defective ureteric bud bifurcation and impaired metanephric mesenchyme condensation in E11.5 embryos, attributable to the compromised Gdnf/Ret signaling, ultimately leading to renal agenesis and hypoplasia/dysplasia. By HRP-induced proximity labelling, we further identify integrin \u03b18\u03b21 as a receptor of Ism1 in E11.5 kidney and demonstrate that Ism1 promoted cell-cell adhesion through interacting with Integrin \u03b18\u03b21, the receptor whose activation is responsible for Gdnf expression and mesenchyme condensation.

Here, we show that the presence of hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein-1 (HAPLN1) in the extracellular matrix enhances tumor cell plasticity and PDAC metastasis. Bioinformatic analysis showed that HAPLN1 expression is enriched in the basal PDAC subtype and associated with worse overall patient survival. In a mouse model for peritoneal carcinomatosis, HAPLN1-induced immunomodulation favors a more permissive microenvironment, which accelerates the peritoneal spread of tumor cells. Mechanistically, HAPLN1, via upregulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2), promotes TNF-mediated upregulation of Hyaluronan (HA) production, facilitating EMT, stemness, invasion and immunomodulation. Extracellular HAPLN1 modifies cancer cells and fibroblasts, rendering them more immunomodulatory. As such, we identify HAPLN1 as a prognostic marker and as a driver for peritoneal metastasis in PDAC."}, {"title": "Mitochondrial complex III deficiency drives c-MYC overexpression and illicit cell cycle entry leading to senescence and segmental progeria", "abstract": "Accumulating evidence suggests mitochondria as key modulators of normal and premature aging, yet whether primary oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) deficiency can cause progeroid disease remains unclear. Here, we show that mice with severe isolated respiratory complex III (CIII) deficiency display nuclear DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, aberrant mitoses, and cellular senescence in the affected organs such as liver and kidney, and a systemic phenotype resembling juvenile-onset progeroid syndromes. Mechanistically, CIII deficiency triggers presymptomatic cancer-like c-MYC upregulation followed by excessive anabolic metabolism and illicit cell proliferation against lack of energy and biosynthetic precursors. Transgenic alternative oxidase dampens mitochondrial integrated stress response and the c-MYC induction, suppresses the illicit proliferation, and prevents juvenile lethality despite that canonical OXPHOS-linked functions remain uncorrected. Inhibition of c-MYC with the dominant-negative Omomyc protein relieves the DNA damage in CIII-deficient hepatocytes in vivo. Our results connect primary OXPHOS deficiency to genomic instability and progeroid pathogenesis and suggest that targeting c-MYC and aberrant cell proliferation may be therapeutic in mitochondrial diseases."}, {"title": "Rhinovirus-induced epithelial RIG-I inflammasome suppresses antiviral immunity and promotes inflammation in asthma and COVID-19", "abstract": "Rhinoviruses and allergens, such as house dust mite are major agents responsible for asthma exacerbations. The influence of pre-existing airway inflammation on the infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is largely unknown. We analyse mechanisms of response to viral infection in experimental in vivo rhinovirus infection in healthy controls and patients with asthma, and in in vitro experiments with house dust mite, rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 in human primary airway epithelium. Here, we show that rhinovirus infection in patients with asthma leads to an excessive RIG-I inflammasome activation, which diminishes its accessibility for type I/III interferon responses, leading to their early functional impairment, delayed resolution, prolonged viral clearance and unresolved inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Pre-exposure to house dust mite augments this phenomenon by inflammasome priming and auxiliary inhibition of early type I/III interferon responses. Prior infection with rhinovirus followed by SARS-CoV-2 infection augments RIG-I inflammasome activation and epithelial inflammation. Timely inhibition of the epithelial RIG-I inflammasome may lead to more efficient viral clearance and lower the burden of rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections."}, {"title": "Immunogenicity and protective efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine encoding secreted non-stabilized spike in female mice", "abstract": "Establishment of an mRNA vaccine platform in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is important to enhance vaccine accessibility and ensure future pandemic preparedness.

In female BALB/c mice, ChulaCov19 at 0.2, 1, 10, and 30 \u03bcg elicits robust neutralizing antibody (NAb) and T cell responses in a dose-dependent relationship. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) of NAb against wild-type (WT, Wuhan-Hu1) virus are 1,280, 11,762, 54,047, and 62,084, respectively. Higher doses induce better cross-NAb against Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.1 and BA.4/5) variants. This elicited immunogenicity is significantly higher than those induced by homologous CoronaVac or AZD1222 vaccination. In a heterologous prime-boost study, ChulaCov19 booster dose generates a 7-fold increase of NAb against Wuhan-Hu1 WT virus and also significantly increases NAb response against Omicron (BA.1 and BA.4/5) when compared to homologous CoronaVac or AZD1222 vaccination. Challenge studies show that ChulaCov19 protects human-ACE-2-expressing female mice from COVID-19 symptoms, prevents viremia and significantly reduces tissue viral load. Moreover, anamnestic NAb response is undetectable in challenge animals. ChulaCov19 is therefore a promising mRNA vaccine candidate either as a primary or boost vaccination and has entered clinical development."}, {"title": "Machine learning prediction of the degree of food processing", "abstract": "Despite the accumulating evidence that increased consumption of ultra-processed food has adverse health implications, it remains difficult to decide what constitutes processed food. Indeed, the current processing-based classification of food has limited coverage and does not differentiate between degrees of processing, hindering consumer choices and slowing research on the health implications of processed food. Here we introduce a machine learning algorithm that accurately predicts the degree of processing for any food, indicating that over 73% of the US food supply is ultra-processed. We show that the increased reliance of an individual\u2019s diet on ultra-processed food correlates with higher risk of metabolic syndrome, diabetes, angina, elevated blood pressure and biological age, and reduces the bio-availability of vitamins. Finally, we find that replacing foods with less processed alternatives can significantly reduce the health implications of ultra-processed food, suggesting that access to information on the degree of processing, currently unavailable to consumers, could improve population health."}, {"title": "Transcription tuned by S-nitrosylation underlies a mechanism for Staphylococcus aureus to circumvent vancomycin killing", "abstract": "Treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infections is a constant challenge due to emerging resistance to vancomycin, a last-resort drug. S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) group to a cysteine thiol, mediates redox-based signaling for eukaryotic cellular functions. However, its role in bacteria is largely unknown. Here, proteomic analysis revealed that\u00a0S-nitrosylation is a prominent growth feature of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus. Deletion of NO synthase (NOS) or removal of S-nitrosylation from the redox-sensitive regulator MgrA or WalR resulted in thinner cell walls and increased vancomycin susceptibility, which was due to attenuated promoter binding and released repression of genes involved in cell wall metabolism. These genes failed to respond to H2O2-induced oxidation, suggesting distinct transcriptional responses to alternative modifications of the cysteine residue. Furthermore, treatment with a NOS inhibitor significantly decreased vancomycin resistance in S. aureus. This study reveals that transcriptional regulation via S-nitrosylation underlies a mechanism for NO-mediated bacterial antibiotic resistance."}, {"title": "3D genome mapping identifies subgroup-specific chromosome conformations and tumor-dependency genes in ependymoma", "abstract": "Ependymoma is a tumor of the brain or spinal cord. The two most common and aggressive molecular groups of ependymoma are the supratentorial ZFTA-fusion associated and the posterior fossa ependymoma group A. In both groups, tumors occur mainly in young children and frequently recur after treatment. Although molecular mechanisms underlying these diseases have recently been uncovered, they remain difficult to target and innovative therapeutic approaches are urgently needed. Here, we use genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C), complemented with CTCF and H3K27ac ChIP-seq, as well as gene expression and DNA methylation analysis in primary and relapsed ependymoma tumors, to identify chromosomal conformations and regulatory mechanisms associated with aberrant gene expression. In particular, we observe the formation of new topologically associating domains (\u2018neo-TADs\u2019) caused by structural variants, group-specific 3D chromatin loops, and the replacement of CTCF insulators by DNA hyper-methylation. Through inhibition experiments, we validate that genes implicated by these 3D genome conformations are essential for the survival of patient-derived ependymoma models in a group-specific manner. Thus, this study extends our ability to reveal tumor-dependency genes by 3D genome conformations even in tumors that lack targetable genetic alterations."}, {"title": "Immune cell dynamics deconvoluted by single-cell RNA sequencing in normothermic machine perfusion of the liver", "abstract": "Normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) has emerged as an innovative organ preservation technique.

We aimed for a comprehensive characterization of immune cell (sub)populations, cell trafficking and cytokine release during liver NMP. Single-cell transcriptome profiling of human donor livers prior to, during NMP and after transplantation shows an abundance of CXC chemokine receptor 1+/2+ (CXCR1+/CXCR2+) neutrophils, which significantly decreased during NMP. This is paralleled by a large efflux of passenger leukocytes with neutrophil predominance in the perfusate. During NMP, neutrophils shift from a pro-inflammatory state towards an aged/chronically activated/exhausted phenotype, while anti-inflammatory/tolerogenic monocytes/macrophages are increased. We herein describe the dynamics of the immune cell repertoire, phenotypic immune cell shifts and a dominance of neutrophils during liver NMP, which potentially contribute to the inflammatory response.

Here, we show that AGGF1 effectively blocks TAA-associated arterial inflammation and remodeling in three different mouse models (mice with transverse aortic constriction, Fbn1C1041G/+ mice, and \u03b2-aminopropionitrile-treated mice). AGGF1 expression is reduced in the ascending aortas from the three models and human TAA patients. Aggf1+/- mice and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC)-specific Aggf1smcKO knockout mice show aggravated TAA phenotypes. Mechanistically, AGGF1 enhances the interaction between its receptor integrin \u03b17 and latency-associated peptide (LAP)-TGF-\u03b21, blocks the cleavage of LAP-TGF-\u03b21 to form mature TGF-\u03b21, and inhibits Smad2/3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in VSMCs. Pirfenidone, a treatment agent for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, inhibits TAA-associated vascular inflammation and remodeling in wild type mice, but not in Aggf1+/- mice. In conclusion, we identify an innovative AGGF1 protein therapeutic strategy to block TAA-associated vascular inflammation and remodeling, and show that efficacy of TGF-\u03b2 inhibition therapies require AGGF1."}, {"title": "Sema3C signaling is an alternative activator of the canonical WNT pathway in glioblastoma", "abstract": "The Wnt pathway is frequently dysregulated in many cancers, underscoring it as a therapeutic target.

Sema3C directs \u03b2-catenin nuclear accumulation in a Rac1-dependent process, leading to transactivation of Wnt target genes. Sema3C-driven Wnt signaling occurred despite suppression of Wnt ligand secretion, suggesting that Sema3C drives canonical Wnt signaling independent of Wnt ligand binding. In a mouse model of glioblastoma, combined depletion of Sema3C and \u03b2-catenin partner TCF1 extended animal survival more than single target inhibition alone. In human glioblastoma, Sema3C expression and Wnt pathway activation were highly concordant. Since Sema3C is frequently overexpressed in glioblastoma, Sema3C signaling may be a significant mechanism of resistance to upstream Wnt pathway inhibitors. Dual targeting of Sema3C and Wnt pathways may achieve clinically significant Wnt pathway inhibition."}, {"title": "Identification of three bacterial species associated with increased appendicular lean mass: the HUNT study", "abstract": "Appendicular lean mass (ALM) associates with mobility and bone mineral density (BMD).

Here, crystal structures of Mtb-RNase J in apo-state and complex with the single-strand RNA reveal the conformational change upon RNA binding and hydrolysis. Mtb-RNase J forms an active homodimer through the interactions between the \u03b2-CASP and the \u03b2-lactamase domain. Knockout of RNase J slows the growth rate and changes the colony morphologies and cell length in Mycobacterium smegmatis, which is restored by RNase J complementation. Finally, RNA-seq analysis shows that the knockout strain significantly changes the expression levels of 49 genes in metabolic pathways. Thus, our current study explores the structural basis of Mtb-RNase J and might provide a promising candidate in pharmacological treatment for tuberculosis."}, {"title": "Integrated transcriptome landscape of ALS identifies genome instability linked to TDP-43 pathology", "abstract": "Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) causes motor neuron degeneration, with 97% of cases exhibiting TDP-43 proteinopathy.

Here, we present a comprehensive compendium of 429 iPSMNs from 15 datasets, and 271 post-mortem spinal cord samples. Using reproducible bioinformatic workflows, we identify robust upregulation of p53 signalling in ALS in both iPSMNs and post-mortem spinal cord. p53 activation is greatest with C9orf72 repeat expansions but is weakest with SOD1 and FUS mutations. TDP-43 depletion potentiates p53 activation in both post-mortem neuronal nuclei and cell culture, thereby functionally linking p53 activation with TDP-43 depletion. ALS iPSMNs and post-mortem tissue display enrichment of splicing alterations, somatic mutations, and gene fusions, possibly contributing to the DNA damage response."}, {"title": "RPL3L-containing ribosomes determine translation elongation dynamics required for cardiac function", "abstract": "Although several ribosomal protein paralogs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, how these proteins affect translation and why they are required only in certain tissues have remained unclear.

Deficiency of RPL3L-containing ribosomes in RPL3L knockout male mice resulted in impaired cardiac contractility. Ribosome occupancy at mRNA codons was found to be altered in the RPL3L-deficient heart, and the changes were negatively correlated with those observed in myoblasts overexpressing RPL3L. RPL3L-containing ribosomes were less prone to collisions compared with RPL3-containing canonical ribosomes. Although the loss of RPL3L-containing ribosomes altered translation elongation dynamics for the entire transcriptome, its effects were most pronounced for transcripts related to cardiac muscle contraction and dilated cardiomyopathy, with the abundance of the encoded proteins being correspondingly decreased.

The aspartic protease plasmepsin X (PMX), processes proteins and proteases essential for merozoite egress from the schizont and invasion of the host erythrocyte, including the leading vaccine candidate PfRh5. PfRh5 is anchored to the merozoite surface through a 5-membered complex (PCRCR), consisting of Plasmodium thrombospondin-related apical merozoite protein, cysteine-rich small secreted protein, Rh5-interacting protein and cysteine-rich protective antigen. Here, we show that PCRCR is processed by PMX in micronemes to remove the N-terminal prodomain of PhRh5 and this activates the function of the complex unmasking a form that can bind basigin on the erythrocyte membrane and mediate merozoite invasion. The ability to activate PCRCR at a specific time in merozoite invasion most likely masks potential deleterious effects of its function until they are required.

They employed three assays, with different sensitivities and specificities, potentially introducing biases in seroprevalence estimates. Using models, we show that accounting for assays explains some of the observed state-to-state variation in seroprevalence, and when integrating case and death surveillance data, we show that when using the Abbott assay, estimates of proportions infected can differ substantially from seroprevalence estimates.

Immune protein profiles of CD45-rich and CD68-rich stromal microenvironments differ significantly. While they typically mirror adjacent, intraepithelial microenvironments, this is not uniformly true.

Antigen-presenting and T-cell activation states are inferred from eigenprotein scores. Such scores within the intraepithelial compartment interact with PD-L1 and IDO1 in ways that suggest prognostic and/or therapeutic potential.

We demonstrate that chronic inhibition of arcuate neurons expressing proopiomelanocortin (POMC) or paraventricular hypothalamic neurons expressing melanocortin receptor 4 (MC4R) causes massive obesity. However, chronic activation of these neuronal populations failed to reduce body weight. Furthermore, gain of function of the melanocortin action through overexpression of MC4R, POMC or its derived peptides had little effect on obesity prevention or reversal. These results reveal a bias of the melanocortin action towards protection of weight loss and provide a neural basis behind the well-known, but mechanistically ill-defined, predisposition to obesity development."}, {"title": "Phosphorylation and stabilization of EZH2 by DCAF1/VprBP trigger aberrant gene silencing in colon cancer", "abstract": "Our recent work has shown that DCAF1 (also known as VprBP) is overexpressed in colon cancer and phosphorylates histone H2AT120 to drive epigenetic gene inactivation and oncogenic transformation. We have extended these observations by investigating whether DCAF1 also phosphorylates non-histone proteins as an additional mechanism linking its kinase activity to colon cancer development. We now demonstrate that DCAF1 phosphorylates EZH2 at T367 to augment its nuclear stabilization and enzymatic activity in colon cancer cells. Consistent with this mechanistic role, DCAF1-mediated EZH2 phosphorylation leads to elevated levels of H3K27me3 and altered expression of growth regulatory genes in cancer cells. Furthermore, our preclinical studies using organoid and xenograft models revealed that EZH2 requires phosphorylation for its oncogenic function, which may have therapeutic implications for gene reactivation in colon cancer cells. Together, our data define a mechanism underlying DCAF1-driven colonic tumorigenesis by linking DCAF1-mediated EZH2 phosphorylation to EZH2 stability that is crucial for establishing H3K27me3 and gene silencing program."}, {"title": "Transcriptomics of Hirschsprung disease patient-derived enteric neural crest cells reveals a role for oxidative phosphorylation", "abstract": "Hirschsprung disease is characterized by the absence of enteric neurons caused by the defects of enteric neural crest cells, leading to intestinal obstruction. Here, using induced pluripotent stem cell-based models of Hirschsprung and single-cell transcriptomic analysis, we identify a gene set of 118 genes commonly dysregulated in all patient enteric neural crest cells, and suggest HDAC1 may be a key regulator of these genes. Furthermore, upregulation of RNA splicing mediators and enhanced alternative splicing events are associated with severe form of Hirschsprung. In particular, the higher inclusion rate of exon 9 in PTBP1 and the perturbed expression of a PTBP1-target, PKM, are significantly enriched in these patient cells, and associated with the defective oxidative phosphorylation and impaired neurogenesis. Hedgehog-induced oxidative phosphorylation significantly enhances the survival and differentiation capacity of patient cells. In sum, we define various factors associated with Hirschsprung pathogenesis and demonstrate the implications of oxidative phosphorylation in enteric neural crest development and HSCR pathogenesis."}, {"title": "Drivers of SARS-CoV-2 testing behaviour: a modelling study using nationwide testing data in England", "abstract": "During the COVID-19 pandemic, national testing programmes were conducted worldwide on unprecedented scales. While testing behaviour is generally recognised as dynamic and complex, current literature demonstrating and quantifying such relationships is scarce, despite its importance for infectious disease surveillance and control. Here, we characterise the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, disease susceptibility/severity, risk perception, and public health measures on SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing behaviour in England over 20 months of the pandemic, by linking testing trends to underlying epidemic trends and contextual meta-data within a systematic conceptual framework. The best-fitting model describing SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing behaviour explained close to 80% of the total deviance in NHS test data. Testing behaviour showed complex associations with factors reflecting transmission level, disease susceptibility/severity (e.g. age, dominant variant, and vaccination), public health measures (e.g. testing strategies and lockdown), and associated changes in risk perception, varying throughout the pandemic and differing between infected and non-infected people."}, {"title": "Priming a vascular-selective cytokine response permits CD8+ T-cell entry into tumors", "abstract": "Targeting DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) has immunomodulatory and anti-neoplastic activity, especially when paired with cancer immunotherapies. Here we explore the immunoregulatory functions of DNMT1 in the tumor vasculature of female mice. Dnmt1 deletion in endothelial cells (ECs) impairs tumor growth while priming expression of cytokine-driven cell adhesion molecules and chemokines important for CD8+ T-cell trafficking across the vasculature; consequently, the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) is enhanced. We find that the proangiogenic factor FGF2 promotes ERK-mediated DNMT1 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation to repress transcription of the chemokines Cxcl9/Cxcl10 in ECs. Targeting Dnmt1 in ECs reduces proliferation but augments Th1 chemokine production and extravasation of CD8+ T-cells, suggesting DNMT1 programs immunologically anergic tumor vasculature. Our study is in good accord with preclinical observations that pharmacologically disrupting DNMT1 enhances the activity of ICB but suggests an epigenetic pathway presumed to be targeted in cancer cells is also operative in the tumor vasculature."}, {"title": "Legionella para-effectors target chromatin and promote bacterial replication", "abstract": "Legionella pneumophila replicates intracellularly by secreting effectors via a type IV secretion system. One of these effectors is a eukaryotic methyltransferase (RomA) that methylates K14 of histone H3 (H3K14me3) to counteract host immune responses. However, it is not known how L. pneumophila infection catalyses H3K14 methylation as this residue is usually acetylated. Here we show that L. pneumophila secretes a eukaryotic-like histone deacetylase (LphD) that specifically targets H3K14ac and works in synergy with RomA. Both effectors target host chromatin and bind the HBO1 histone acetyltransferase complex that acetylates H3K14. Full activity of RomA is dependent on the presence of LphD as H3K14 methylation levels are significantly decreased in a \u2206lphD mutant. The dependency of these two chromatin-modifying effectors on each other is further substantiated by mutational and virulence assays revealing that the presence of only one of these two effectors impairs intracellular replication, while a double knockout (\u2206lphD\u2206romA) can restore intracellular replication. Uniquely, we present evidence for \u201cpara-effectors\u201d, an effector pair, that actively and coordinately modify host histones to hijack the host response.

However, it is largely unknown which protein targets are affected by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in cardiomyocytes that underly impaired inotropic effects during oxidative stress. Here, we combine a chemogenetic mouse model (HyPer-DAO mice) and a redox-proteomics approach to identify redox sensitive proteins. Using the HyPer-DAO mice, we demonstrate that increased endogenous production of H2O2 in cardiomyocytes leads to a reversible impairment of cardiac contractility in vivo. Notably, we identify the \u03b3-subunit of the TCA cycle enzyme isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)3 as a redox switch, linking its modification to altered mitochondrial metabolism. Using microsecond molecular dynamics simulations and experiments using cysteine-gene-edited cells reveal that IDH3\u03b3 Cys148 and 284 are critically involved in the H2O2-dependent regulation of IDH3 activity. Our findings provide an unexpected mechanism by which mitochondrial metabolism can be modulated through redox signaling processes."}, {"title": "Repurposing host-guest chemistry to sequester virulence and eradicate biofilms in multidrug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii", "abstract": "The limited diversity in targets of available antibiotic therapies has put tremendous pressure on the treatment of bacterial pathogens, where numerous resistance mechanisms that counteract their function are becoming increasingly prevalent. Here, we utilize an unconventional anti-virulence screen of host-guest interacting macrocycles, and identify a water-soluble synthetic macrocycle, Pillar[5]arene, that is non-bactericidal/bacteriostatic and has a mechanism of action that involves binding to both homoserine lactones and lipopolysaccharides, key virulence factors in Gram-negative pathogens. Pillar[5]arene is active against Top Priority carbapenem- and third/fourth-generation cephalosporin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, suppressing toxins and biofilms and increasing the penetration and efficacy of standard-of-care antibiotics in combined administrations. The binding of homoserine lactones and lipopolysaccharides also sequesters their direct effects as toxins on eukaryotic membranes, neutralizing key tools that promote bacterial colonization and impede immune defenses, both in vitro and in vivo. Pillar[5]arene evades both existing antibiotic resistance mechanisms, as well as the build-up of rapid tolerance/resistance. The versatility of macrocyclic host-guest chemistry provides ample strategies for tailored targeting of virulence in a wide range of Gram-negative infectious diseases."}, {"title": "Histopathology images predict multi-omics aberrations and prognoses in colorectal cancer patients", "abstract": "Histopathologic assessment is indispensable for diagnosing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, manual evaluation of the diseased tissues under the microscope cannot reliably inform patient prognosis or genomic variations crucial for treatment selections.

MOMA successfully predicts the overall survival, disease-free survival (log-rank test P-value<0.05), and copy number alterations of CRC patients. In addition, our approaches identify interpretable pathology patterns predictive of gene expression profiles, microsatellite instability status, and clinically actionable genetic alterations. We show that MOMA models are generalizable to multiple patient populations with different demographic compositions and pathology images collected from distinctive digitization methods. Our machine learning approaches provide clinically actionable predictions that could inform treatments for colorectal cancer patients."}, {"title": "Extracellular vesicles engineering by silicates-activated endothelial progenitor cells for myocardial infarction treatment in male mice", "abstract": "Extracellular vesicles have shown good potential in disease treatments including ischemic injury such as myocardial infarction. However, the efficient production of highly active extracellular vesicles is one of the critical limitations for their clinical applications. Here, we demonstrate a biomaterial-based approach to prepare high amounts of extracellular vesicles with high bioactivity from endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) by stimulation with silicate ions derived from bioactive silicate ceramics. We further show that hydrogel microspheres containing engineered extracellular vesicles are highly effective in the treatment of myocardial infarction in male mice by significantly enhancing angiogenesis. This therapeutic effect is attributed to significantly enhanced revascularization by the high content of miR-126a-3p and angiogenic factors such as VEGF and SDF-1, CXCR4 and eNOS in engineered extracellular vesicles, which not only activate endothelial cells but also recruit EPCs from the circulatory system."}, {"title": "Excessive serine from the bone marrow microenvironment impairs megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis in Multiple Myeloma", "abstract": "Thrombocytopenia is a major complication in a subset of patients with multiple myeloma (MM). However, little is known about its development and significance during MM. Here, we show thrombocytopenia is linked to poor prognosis in MM. In addition, we identify serine, which is released from MM cells into the bone marrow microenvironment, as a key metabolic factor that suppresses megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis. The impact of excessive serine on thrombocytopenia is mainly mediated through the suppression of megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation. Extrinsic serine is transported into MKs through SLC38A1 and downregulates SVIL via SAM-mediated tri-methylation of H3K9, ultimately leading to the impairment of megakaryopoiesis. Inhibition of serine utilization or treatment with TPO enhances megakaryopoiesis and thrombopoiesis and suppresses MM progression. Together, we identify serine as a key metabolic regulator of thrombocytopenia, unveil molecular mechanisms governing MM progression, and provide potential therapeutic strategies for treating MM patients by targeting thrombocytopenia."}, {"title": "Non-functional ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 drives podocyte injury through impairing proteasomes in autoimmune glomerulonephritis", "abstract": "Little is known about the mechanistic significance of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) in a kidney autoimmune environment. In membranous nephropathy (MN), autoantibodies target podocytes of the glomerular filter resulting in proteinuria. Converging biochemical, structural, mouse pathomechanistic, and clinical information we report that the deubiquitinase Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is induced by oxidative stress in podocytes and is directly involved in proteasome substrate accumulation. Mechanistically, this toxic gain-of-function is mediated by non-functional UCH-L1, which interacts with and thereby impairs proteasomes. In experimental MN, UCH-L1 becomes non-functional and MN patients with poor outcome exhibit autoantibodies with preferential reactivity to non-functional UCH-L1. Podocyte-specific deletion of UCH-L1 protects from experimental MN, whereas overexpression of non-functional UCH-L1 impairs podocyte proteostasis and drives injury in mice. In conclusion, the UPS is pathomechanistically linked to podocyte disease by aberrant proteasomal interactions of non-functional UCH-L1."}, {"title": "Antimicrobial exposure is associated with decreased survival in triple-negative breast cancer", "abstract": "Antimicrobial exposure during curative-intent treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) may lead to gut microbiome dysbiosis, decreased circulating and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and inferior outcomes.

Of 772 women with stage I-III TNBC treated with and without standard cytotoxic chemotherapy \u2013 prior to the immune checkpoint inhibitor era \u2013 most (654, 85%) used antimicrobials. Applying multivariate analyses, we show that each additional total or unique monthly antimicrobial prescription is associated with inferior overall and breast cancer-specific survival.

In both participants, SCES enabled voluntary increased muscle activation and movement below the injury and decreased assistance during exoskeleton-assisted walking. After permanent implantation, both participants voluntarily modulated induced torques but not always in the intended directions. In one participant, percutaneous SCES enabled motor control below the injury one-day following temporary implantation as confirmed by electromyography. The same participant achieved independent standing with minimal upper extremity self-balance assistance, independent stepping in parallel bars and overground ambulation with a walker. SCES via percutaneous leads holds promise for enhancing rehabilitation and enabling motor functions for people with SCI."}, {"title": "Plasma neurodegeneration biomarker concentrations associate with glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic measures in neurological disorders", "abstract": "Clearance of neurotoxic brain proteins via cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to blood has recently emerged to be crucial, and plasma biomarkers of neurodegeneration were newly introduced to predict neurological disease.

We also examine how biomarkers vary during daytime and associate with subjective sleep quality. Plasma concentrations of neurodegeneration markers associate with indices of glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic functions in individual- and disease-specific manners, vary during daytime, but are unaffected by sleep quality. The results suggest that plasma concentrations of neurodegeneration biomarkers associate with measures of glymphatic and meningeal lymphatic function."}, {"title": "Dual domain recognition determines SARS-CoV-2 PLpro selectivity for human ISG15 and K48-linked di-ubiquitin", "abstract": "The Papain-like protease (PLpro) is a domain of a multi-functional, non-structural protein 3 of coronaviruses. PLpro cleaves viral polyproteins and posttranslational conjugates with poly-ubiquitin and protective ISG15, composed of two ubiquitin-like (UBL) domains. Across coronaviruses, PLpro showed divergent selectivity for recognition and cleavage of posttranslational conjugates despite sequence conservation. We show that SARS-CoV-2 PLpro binds human ISG15 and K48-linked di-ubiquitin (K48-Ub2) with nanomolar affinity and detect alternate weaker-binding modes. Crystal structures of untethered PLpro complexes with ISG15 and K48-Ub2 combined with solution NMR and cross-linking mass spectrometry revealed how the two domains of ISG15 or K48-Ub2 are differently utilized in interactions with PLpro. Analysis of protein interface energetics predicted differential binding stabilities of the two UBL/Ub domains that were validated experimentally. We emphasize how substrate recognition can be tuned to cleave specifically ISG15 or K48-Ub2 modifications while retaining capacity to cleave mono-Ub conjugates. These results highlight alternative druggable surfaces that would inhibit PLpro function."}, {"title": "Fast, accurate antibody structure prediction from deep learning on massive set of natural antibodies", "abstract": "Antibodies have the capacity to bind a diverse set of antigens, and they have become critical therapeutics and diagnostic molecules.

IgFold consists of a pre-trained language model trained on 558 million natural antibody sequences followed by graph networks that directly predict backbone atom coordinates. IgFold predicts structures of similar or better quality than alternative methods (including AlphaFold) in significantly less time (under 25\u2009s). Accurate structure prediction on this timescale makes possible avenues of investigation that were previously infeasible.

There is growing interest in engineering carboxysomes into crop chloroplasts as a potential route for improving photosynthesis and crop yields. Here, we generate morphologically correct carboxysomes in tobacco chloroplasts by transforming nine carboxysome genetic components derived from a proteobacterium. The chloroplast-expressed carboxysomes display a structural and functional integrity comparable to native carboxysomes and support autotrophic growth and photosynthesis of the transplastomic plants at elevated CO2.

Inflammatory conditions increased ITF2 and p65 expression both ex vivo and in vivo, and ITF2 and p65 showed positive correlations. p65 overexpression stabilized ITF2 protein levels by interfering with the binding of Parkin to ITF2. More specifically, the C-terminus of p65 binds to the N-terminus of ITF2 and inhibits ubiquitination, thereby promoting ITF2 stabilization. Parkin acts as a E3 ubiquitin ligase for ITF2 ubiquitination. Intestinal epithelial-specific deletion of ITF2 facilitated nuclear translocation of p65 and thus increased colitis-associated cancer tumorigenesis, which was mediated by Azoxymethane/Dextran sulfate sodium or dextran sulfate sodium. Upregulated ITF2 expression was lost in carcinoma tissues of colitis-associated cancer patients, whereas p65 expression much more increased in both dysplastic and carcinoma regions. Therefore, these findings indicate a critical role for ITF2 in the repression of colitis-associated cancer progression and ITF2 would be an attractive target against inflammatory diseases including colitis-associated cancer."}, {"title": "Bone marrow endosteal stem cells dictate active osteogenesis and aggressive tumorigenesis", "abstract": "The bone marrow contains various populations of skeletal stem cells (SSCs) in the stromal compartment, which are important regulators of bone formation.

These Fgfr3-creER-marked endosteal stromal cells contribute to a stem cell fraction in young stages, which is later replaced by Lepr-cre-marked stromal cells in adult stages. Further, Fgfr3+ endosteal stromal cells give rise to aggressive osteosarcoma-like lesions upon loss of p53 tumor suppressor through unregulated self-renewal and aberrant osteogenic fates. Therefore, Fgfr3+ endosteal SSCs are abundant in young bone marrow and provide a robust source of osteoblasts, contributing to both normal and aberrant osteogenesis."}, {"title": "Soluble pathogenic tau enters brain vascular endothelial cells and drives cellular senescence and brain microvascular dysfunction in a mouse model of tauopathy", "abstract": "Vascular mechanisms of Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) may constitute a therapeutically addressable biological pathway underlying dementia.

Microvascular impairments in P301S(PS19) mice were partially negated by selective removal of pathogenic soluble tau aggregates from brain. We found that similar to trans-neuronal transmission of pathogenic forms of tau, soluble tau aggregates are internalized by brain microvascular endothelial cells in a heparin-sensitive manner and induce microtubule destabilization, block endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activation, and potently induce endothelial cell senescence that was recapitulated in vivo in microvasculature of P301S(PS19) mice.

Here we show that miR-483-5p in the amygdala of male mice counterbalances the structural, functional and behavioural consequences of stress to promote a reduction in anxiety-like behaviour. Upon stress, miR-483-5p is upregulated in the synaptic compartment of amygdala neurons and directly represses three stress-associated genes: Pgap2, Gpx3 and Macf1. Upregulation of miR-483-5p leads to selective contraction of distal parts of the dendritic arbour and conversion of immature filopodia into mature, mushroom-like dendritic spines. Consistent with its role in reducing the stress response, upregulation of miR-483-5p in the basolateral amygdala produces a reduction in anxiety-like behaviour. Stress-induced neuromorphological and behavioural effects of miR-483-5p can be recapitulated by shRNA mediated suppression of Pgap2 and prevented by simultaneous overexpression of miR-483-5p-resistant Pgap2.

We find that fewer than half of all projects included human dimension objectives (42%), but that projects including human dimension objectives were associated with improved wildlife population outcomes (i.e., higher probability of survival, reproduction, or population growth).

The model demonstrated high performance for predicting cases of autoantibody-tested individuals in a validation set, an external test set, and an independent cohort with a broader case definition. This approach identified more individuals for autoantibody testing compared with current clinical standards and a greater proportion of autoantibody carriers among those tested. Diagnoses of SARDs and other autoimmune conditions increased with higher model probabilities.

BHR-sRNA is tested in 16 bacterial species including commensal, probiotic, pathogenic, and industrial bacteria, with >50% of target gene knockdown achieved in 12 bacterial species. For medical applications, virulence factors in Staphylococcus epidermidis and Klebsiella pneumoniae are knocked down to mitigate their virulence-associated phenotypes. For metabolic engineering applications, high performance Corynebacterium glutamicum strains capable of producing valerolactam (bulk chemical) and methyl anthranilate (fine chemical) are developed by combinatorial knockdown of target genes. A genome-scale sRNA library covering 2959\u2009C. glutamicum genes is constructed for high-throughput colorimetric screening of indigoidine (natural colorant) overproducers.

However, the roles and underlying neural circuits of the PSTN in wakefulness remain unclear. Neurons expressing calretinin (CR) account for the majority of PSTN neurons. In this study in male mice, fiber photometry recordings showed that the activity of PSTNCR neurons increased at the transitions from non-rapid eye movement (non-REM, NREM) sleep to either wakefulness or REM sleep, as well as exploratory behavior. Chemogenetic and optogenetic experiments demonstrated that PSTNCR neurons were necessary for initiating and/or maintaining arousal associated with exploration. Photoactivation of projections of PSTNCR neurons revealed that they regulated exploration-related wakefulness by innervating the ventral tegmental area. Collectively, our findings indicate that PSTNCR circuitry is essential for the induction and maintenance of the awake state associated with exploration."}, {"title": "A small secreted protein NICOL regulates lumicrine-mediated sperm maturation and male fertility", "abstract": "The mammalian spermatozoa produced in the testis require functional maturation in the epididymis for their full competence. Epididymal sperm maturation is regulated by lumicrine signalling pathways in which testis-derived secreted signals relocate to the epididymis lumen and promote functional differentiation. However, the detailed mechanisms of lumicrine regulation are unclear. Herein, we demonstrate that a small secreted protein, NELL2-interacting cofactor for lumicrine signalling (NICOL), plays a crucial role in lumicrine signalling in mice. NICOL is expressed in male reproductive organs, including the testis, and forms a complex with the testis-secreted protein NELL2, which is transported transluminally from the testis to the epididymis. Males lacking Nicol are sterile due to impaired NELL2-mediated lumicrine signalling, leading to defective epididymal differentiation and deficient sperm maturation but can be restored by NICOL expression in testicular germ cells. Our results demonstrate how lumicrine signalling regulates epididymal function for successful sperm maturation and male fertility."}, {"title": "A massively parallel screening platform for converting aptamers into molecular switches", "abstract": "Aptamer-based molecular switches that undergo a binding-induced conformational change have proven valuable for a wide range of applications, such as imaging metabolites in cells, targeted drug delivery, and real-time detection of biomolecules. Since conventional aptamer selection methods do not typically produce aptamers with inherent structure-switching functionality, the aptamers must be converted to molecular switches in a post-selection process. Efforts to engineer such aptamer switches often use rational design approaches based on in silico secondary structure predictions. Unfortunately, existing software cannot accurately model three-dimensional oligonucleotide structures or non-canonical base-pairing, limiting the ability to identify appropriate sequence elements for targeted modification. Here, we describe a massively parallel screening-based strategy that enables the conversion of virtually any aptamer into a molecular switch without requiring any prior knowledge of aptamer structure. Using this approach, we generate multiple switches from a previously published ATP aptamer as well as a newly-selected boronic acid base-modified aptamer for glucose, which respectively undergo signal-on and signal-off switching upon binding their molecular targets with second-scale kinetics. Notably, our glucose-responsive switch achieves ~30-fold greater sensitivity than a previously-reported natural DNA-based switch. We believe our approach could offer a generalizable strategy for producing target-specific switches from a wide range of aptamers."}, {"title": "Structural basis for botulinum neurotoxin E recognition of synaptic vesicle protein 2", "abstract": "Botulinum neurotoxin E (BoNT/E) is one of the major causes of human botulism and paradoxically also a promising therapeutic agent. Here we determined the co-crystal structures of the receptor-binding domain of BoNT/E (HCE) in complex with its neuronal receptor synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A (SV2A) and a nanobody that serves as a ganglioside surrogate. These structures reveal that the protein-protein interactions between HCE and SV2 provide the crucial location and specificity information for HCE to recognize SV2A and SV2B, but not the closely related SV2C. At the same time, HCE exploits a separated sialic acid-binding pocket to mediate recognition of an N-glycan of SV2. Structure-based mutagenesis and functional studies demonstrate that both the protein-protein and protein-glycan associations are essential for SV2A-mediated cell entry of BoNT/E and for its potent neurotoxicity. Our studies establish the structural basis to understand the receptor-specificity of BoNT/E and to engineer BoNT/E variants for new clinical applications."}, {"title": "Associations between in vitro, in vivo and in silico cell classes in mouse primary visual cortex", "abstract": "The brain consists of many cell classes yet in vivo electrophysiology recordings are typically unable to identify and monitor their activity in the behaving animal.

We used biophysical models to map the two one- and the six multi-channel clusters to specific in vitro classes with unique morphology, excitability and conductance properties that explain their distinct extracellular signatures and functional characteristics. These concepts were tested in ground-truth optotagging experiments with two inhibitory classes unveiling distinct in vivo properties. This multi-modal approach presents a powerful way to separate in vivo clusters and infer their cellular properties from first principles."}, {"title": "Addressable and adaptable intercellular communication via DNA messaging", "abstract": "Engineered consortia are a major research focus for synthetic biologists because they can implement sophisticated behaviors inaccessible to single-strain systems.

DNA messaging, by enabling information-rich channel-decoupled communication, is a promising candidate architecture for implementing complex communication. But its major advantage, its messages\u2019 dynamic mutability, is still unexplored. We develop a framework for addressable and adaptable DNA messaging that leverages all three of these advantages and implement it using plasmid conjugation in E. coli. Our system can bias the transfer of messages to targeted receiver strains by 100- to 1000-fold, and their recipient lists can be dynamically updated in situ to control the flow of information through the population.

Here, we show that mice with severe isolated respiratory complex III (CIII) deficiency display nuclear DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, aberrant mitoses, and cellular senescence in the affected organs such as liver and kidney, and a systemic phenotype resembling juvenile-onset progeroid syndromes. Mechanistically, CIII deficiency triggers presymptomatic cancer-like c-MYC upregulation followed by excessive anabolic metabolism and illicit cell proliferation against lack of energy and biosynthetic precursors. Transgenic alternative oxidase dampens mitochondrial integrated stress response and the c-MYC induction, suppresses the illicit proliferation, and prevents juvenile lethality despite that canonical OXPHOS-linked functions remain uncorrected. Inhibition of c-MYC with the dominant-negative Omomyc protein relieves the DNA damage in CIII-deficient hepatocytes in vivo. Our results connect primary OXPHOS deficiency to genomic instability and progeroid pathogenesis and suggest that targeting c-MYC and aberrant cell proliferation may be therapeutic in mitochondrial diseases."}, {"title": "Tradeoff between lag time and growth rate drives the plasmid acquisition cost", "abstract": "Conjugative plasmids drive genetic diversity and evolution in microbial populations. Despite their prevalence, plasmids can impose long-term fitness costs on their hosts, altering population structure, growth dynamics, and evolutionary outcomes. In addition to long-term fitness costs, acquiring a new plasmid introduces an immediate, short-term perturbation to the cell. However, due to the transient nature of this plasmid acquisition cost, a quantitative understanding of its physiological manifestations, overall magnitudes, and population-level implications, remains unclear. To address this, here we track growth of single colonies immediately following plasmid acquisition. We find that plasmid acquisition costs are primarily driven by changes in lag time, rather than growth rate, for nearly 60 conditions covering diverse plasmids, selection environments, and clinical strains/species. Surprisingly, for a costly plasmid, clones exhibiting longer lag times also achieve faster recovery growth rates, suggesting an evolutionary tradeoff. Modeling and experiments demonstrate that this tradeoff leads to counterintuitive ecological dynamics, whereby intermediate-cost plasmids outcompete both their low and high-cost counterparts. These results suggest that, unlike fitness costs, plasmid acquisition dynamics are not uniformly driven by minimizing growth disadvantages. Moreover, a lag/growth tradeoff has clear implications in predicting the ecological outcomes and intervention strategies of bacteria undergoing conjugation."}, {"title": "TMEM25 inhibits monomeric EGFR-mediated STAT3 activation in basal state to suppress triple-negative breast cancer progression", "abstract": "Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a subtype of breast cancer with poor outcome and lacks of approved targeted therapy. Overexpression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is found in more than 50% TNBC and is suggested as a driving force in progression of TNBC; however, targeting EGFR using antibodies to prevent its dimerization and activation shows no significant benefits for TNBC patients. Here we report that EGFR monomer may activate signal transducer activator of transcription-3 (STAT3) in the absence of transmembrane protein TMEM25, whose expression is frequently decreased in human TNBC. Deficiency of TMEM25 allows EGFR monomer to phosphorylate STAT3 independent of ligand binding, and thus enhances basal STAT3 activation to promote TNBC progression in female mice. Moreover, supplying TMEM25 by adeno-associated virus strongly suppresses STAT3 activation and TNBC progression. Hence, our study reveals a role of monomeric-EGFR/STAT3 signaling pathway in TNBC progression and points out a potential targeted therapy for TNBC."}, {"title": "In silico cancer immunotherapy trials uncover the consequences of therapy-specific response patterns for clinical trial design and outcome", "abstract": "Late-stage cancer immunotherapy trials often lead to unusual survival curve shapes, like delayed curve separation or a plateauing curve in the treatment arm.

Metastatic spreading is promoted by cancer cell plasticity, yet its regulation by the microenvironment is incompletely understood. Here, we show that the presence of hyaluronan and proteoglycan link protein-1 (HAPLN1) in the extracellular matrix enhances tumor cell plasticity and PDAC metastasis. Bioinformatic analysis showed that HAPLN1 expression is enriched in the basal PDAC subtype and associated with worse overall patient survival. In a mouse model for peritoneal carcinomatosis, HAPLN1-induced immunomodulation favors a more permissive microenvironment, which accelerates the peritoneal spread of tumor cells. Mechanistically, HAPLN1, via upregulation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (TNFR2), promotes TNF-mediated upregulation of Hyaluronan (HA) production, facilitating EMT, stemness, invasion and immunomodulation. Extracellular HAPLN1 modifies cancer cells and fibroblasts, rendering them more immunomodulatory. As such, we identify HAPLN1 as a prognostic marker and as a driver for peritoneal metastasis in PDAC."}, {"title": "Sample-to-answer platform for the clinical evaluation of COVID-19 using a deep learning-assisted smartphone-based assay", "abstract": "Since many lateral flow assays (LFA) are tested daily, the improvement in accuracy can greatly impact individual patient care and public health.

Combining clinical data learning and two-step algorithms enables a cradle-free on-site assay with higher accuracy than the untrained individuals and human experts via blind tests of clinical data (n\u2009=\u20091500). We acquired 98% accuracy across 135 smartphone application-based clinical tests with different users/smartphones.

We envision a smartphone-based SMARTAI-LFA that allows continuously enhanced performance by adding clinical tests and satisfies the new criterion for digitalized real-time diagnostics."}, {"title": "Rhinovirus-induced epithelial RIG-I inflammasome suppresses antiviral immunity and promotes inflammation in asthma and COVID-19", "abstract": "Rhinoviruses and allergens, such as house dust mite are major agents responsible for asthma exacerbations. The influence of pre-existing airway inflammation on the infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is largely unknown. We analyse mechanisms of response to viral infection in experimental in vivo rhinovirus infection in healthy controls and patients with asthma, and in in vitro experiments with house dust mite, rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 in human primary airway epithelium. Here, we show that rhinovirus infection in patients with asthma leads to an excessive RIG-I inflammasome activation, which diminishes its accessibility for type I/III interferon responses, leading to their early functional impairment, delayed resolution, prolonged viral clearance and unresolved inflammation in vitro and in vivo. Pre-exposure to house dust mite augments this phenomenon by inflammasome priming and auxiliary inhibition of early type I/III interferon responses. Prior infection with rhinovirus followed by SARS-CoV-2 infection augments RIG-I inflammasome activation and epithelial inflammation. Timely inhibition of the epithelial RIG-I inflammasome may lead to more efficient viral clearance and lower the burden of rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections."}, {"title": "Transcription factor binding site orientation and order are major drivers of gene regulatory activity", "abstract": "The gene regulatory code and grammar remain largely unknown, precluding our ability to link phenotype to genotype in regulatory sequences.

Corroborating these results with genomic analyses, we find clear human promoter TFBS orientation biases and similar TFBS orientation and order transcriptional effects in an MPRA that tested 164,307 liver candidate regulatory elements. Additionally, by adding TFBS orientation to a model that predicts expression from sequence we improve performance by 7.7%.

Typically, the synthesized bioluminescent probes are made of glucose polymer (GP), luciferase, Cy5 and ICG-modified silicon nanoparticles and their substrates are made of GP and D-luciferin-modified silicon nanoparticles. Compared with bacteria with mutations in transporters, which hardly internalize the probes in vitro (i.e., ~2% of uptake rate), various bacteria could robustly engulf the probes with a high uptake rate of around 50%. Notably, the developed strategy enables ex vivo bioluminescence imaging of human vitreous containing ten species of pathogens collected from patients with bacterial endophthalmitis.

Siglec-glycolipid interactions are often studied outside the context of a lipid bilayer, missing the complex behaviors of glycolipids in a membrane. Through optimizing a liposomal formulation to dissect Siglec\u2013glycolipid interactions, it is shown that Siglec-6 can recognize glycolipids independent of its canonical binding pocket, suggesting that Siglec-6 possesses a secondary binding pocket tailored for recognizing glycolipids in a bilayer. A panel of synthetic neoglycolipids is used to probe the specificity of this glycolipid binding pocket on Siglec-6, leading to the development of a neoglycolipid with higher avidity for Siglec-6 compared to natural glycolipids. This neoglycolipid facilitates the delivery of liposomes to Siglec-6 on human mast cells, memory B-cells and placental syncytiotrophoblasts. A physiological relevance for glycolipid recognition by Siglec-6 is revealed for the binding and internalization of extracellular vesicles. These results demonstrate a unique and physiologically relevant ability of Siglec-6 to recognize glycolipids in a membrane."}, {"title": "IS21 family transposase cleaved donor complex traps two right-handed superhelical crossings", "abstract": "Transposases are ubiquitous enzymes that catalyze DNA rearrangement events with broad impacts on gene expression, genome evolution, and the spread of drug-resistance in bacteria.

Solution studies show that IstA engages the transposon terminal sequences to form a high-molecular weight complex and promote DNA integration. A 3.4\u2009\u00c5 resolution structure of the transposase bound to transposon ends corroborates our biochemical findings and reveals that IstA self-assembles into a highly intertwined tetramer that synapses two supercoiled terminal inverted repeats.

The obtained X-ray and cryo-EM structures reveal that the trimerization core and interactions promoting RPA clustering on ssDNA are shared between archaea and eukaryotes. However, we also identified a helical domain named AROD (Acidic Rpa1 OB-binding Domain), and showed that, in Archaea, RPA forms an unanticipated tetrameric supercomplex in the absence of DNA.

We report a bifurcated helix in one newly identified state from NMR and single-molecule FRET (smFRET) results, and its presence directs the translation inhibition in our cellular translation experiments. A model is proposed to illustrate the distinct switch patterns and gene-regulatory outcome of riboSAM when SAM is present or absent.

We show that, in addition to effects attributed to propagule pressure caused by human intervention, species with higher fecundity, longer lifespan and larger size tend to be more invasive. Community invasibility peaks when the functional distance among native species was high, leaving unoccupied functional space for the establishment of potential invaders. Our findings illustrate how the functional traits of non-native species determining their invasiveness, and the functional characteristics of the invaded community determining its invasibility, may be identified.

Under flooding conditions, coleoptile elongation can function as an escape strategy that contributes to submergence tolerance during seed germination in rice; however, the underlying molecular bases have yet to be fully determined. Herein, we report that natural variation of rice coleoptile length subjected to submergence is determined by the glucosyltransferase encoding gene OsUGT75A. OsUGT75A regulates coleoptile length via decreasing free abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) levels by promoting glycosylation of these two phytohormones under submergence. Moreover, we find that OsUGT75A accelerates coleoptile length through mediating the interactions between JASMONATE ZIMDOMAIN (OsJAZ) and ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE (OsABI) proteins. Last, we reveal the origin of the haplotype that contributes to coleoptile length in response to submergence and transferring this haplotype to indica rice can enhance coleoptile length in submergence conditions.

Nevertheless, we find that the transcriptional profile of similar fibroblast subsets differs markedly between the small intestine and colon suggesting region specific functions. We perform in vivo transplantation and lineage-tracing experiments to demonstrate that adult intestinal fibroblast subsets, smooth muscle cells and pericytes derive from Gli1-expressing precursors present in embryonic day 12.5 intestine. Trajectory analysis of single cell RNA-seq datasets of E12.5 and adult mesenchymal cells suggest that adult smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts derive from distinct embryonic intermediates and that adult fibroblast subsets develop in a linear trajectory from CD81+ fibroblasts.

TPR recruits the TRanscription and EXport complex (TREX)\u22122 to the NPC for exporting a subset of cellular mRNAs. By degrading components of the TREX-2 complex (GANP, Germinal-center Associated Nuclear Protein; PCID2, PCI domain containing 2), we show that influenza mRNAs require the TREX-2 complex for nuclear export and replication. Furthermore, we found that cellular mRNAs whose export is dependent on GANP have a small number of exons, a high mean exon length, long 3\u2019 UTR, and low GC content. Some of these features are shared by influenza virus mRNAs. Additionally, we identified a 45 nucleotide RNA signal from influenza virus HA mRNA that is sufficient to mediate GANP-dependent mRNA export.

Results show item-specific hippocampal pattern similarity between original-event and post-event stages.

Here, using a conditional knockout mouse model, we revealed that the RNA-binding protein SYNCRIP is required for maintenance of blood homeostasis especially after regenerative stress due to defects in HSCs and progenitors. Mechanistically, we find that SYNCRIP loss results in a failure to maintain proteome homeostasis that is essential for HSC maintenance. SYNCRIP depletion results in increased protein synthesis, a dysregulated epichaperome, an accumulation of misfolded proteins and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress. Additionally, we find that SYNCRIP is required for translation of CDC42 RHO-GTPase, and loss of SYNCRIP results in defects in polarity, asymmetric segregation, and dilution of unfolded proteins. Forced expression of CDC42 recovers polarity and in vitro replating activities of HSCs.

Here, we demonstrate that chromatin looping and VK-JK recombination at the Igk locus were insensitive to Wapl upregulation in pre-B cells. Notably, the Wapl protein was expressed at a 2.2-fold higher level in pre-B cells compared with pro-B cells, which resulted in a distinct chromosomal architecture with normal loop sizes in pre-B cells. High-resolution chromosomal contact analysis of the Igk locus identified multiple internal loops, which likely juxtapose VK and JK elements to facilitate VK-JK recombination. The higher Wapl expression in Ig\u03bc-transgenic pre-B cells prevented extended loop extrusion at the Igh locus, leading to recombination of only the 6 most 3\u2019 proximal VH genes and likely to allelic exclusion of all other VH genes in pre-B cells.

In practice, objects are rarely good every time or everywhere, but only at the right time or place. Whereas the basal ganglia (BG) are known to mediate goal-directed behavior, for example, saccades to rewarding objects, it remains unclear how such simple behaviors are rendered contingent on higher-order factors, including environmental context. Here we show that amygdala neurons are sensitive to environments and may regulate putative dopamine (DA) neurons via an inhibitory projection to the substantia nigra (SN). In male macaques, we combined optogenetics with multi-channel recording to demonstrate that rewarding environments induce tonic firing changes in DA neurons as well as phasic responses to rewarding events. These responses may be mediated by disinhibition via a GABAergic projection onto DA neurons, which in turn is suppressed by an inhibitory projection from the amygdala. Thus, the amygdala may provide an additional source of learning to BG circuits, namely contingencies imposed by the environment."}, {"title": "Control of a hippocampal recurrent excitatory circuit by cannabinoid receptor-interacting protein Gap43", "abstract": "The type-1 cannabinoid receptor (CB1R) is widely expressed in excitatory and inhibitory nerve terminals, and by suppressing neurotransmitter release, its activation modulates neural circuits and brain function.

Using a high-throughput proteomic analysis complemented with an array of in vitro and in vivo approaches in the mouse brain, we report that the C-terminal, intracellular domain of CB1R interacts specifically with growth-associated protein of 43\u2009kDa (GAP43). The CB1R-GAP43 interaction occurs selectively at mossy cell axon boutons, which establish excitatory synapses with dentate granule cells in the hippocampus. This interaction impairs CB1R-mediated suppression of mossy cell to granule cell transmission, thereby inhibiting cannabinoid-mediated anti-convulsant activity in mice.

In female BALB/c mice, ChulaCov19 at 0.2, 1, 10, and 30 \u03bcg elicits robust neutralizing antibody (NAb) and T cell responses in a dose-dependent relationship. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) of NAb against wild-type (WT, Wuhan-Hu1) virus are 1,280, 11,762, 54,047, and 62,084, respectively. Higher doses induce better cross-NAb against Delta (B.1.617.2) and Omicron (BA.1 and BA.4/5) variants. This elicited immunogenicity is significantly higher than those induced by homologous CoronaVac or AZD1222 vaccination. In a heterologous prime-boost study, ChulaCov19 booster dose generates a 7-fold increase of NAb against Wuhan-Hu1 WT virus and also significantly increases NAb response against Omicron (BA.1 and BA.4/5) when compared to homologous CoronaVac or AZD1222 vaccination. Challenge studies show that ChulaCov19 protects human-ACE-2-expressing female mice from COVID-19 symptoms, prevents viremia and significantly reduces tissue viral load. Moreover, anamnestic NAb response is undetectable in challenge animals. ChulaCov19 is therefore a promising mRNA vaccine candidate either as a primary or boost vaccination and has entered clinical development."}, {"title": "Transcription tuned by S-nitrosylation underlies a mechanism for Staphylococcus aureus to circumvent vancomycin killing", "abstract": "Treatment of Staphylococcus aureus infections is a constant challenge due to emerging resistance to vancomycin, a last-resort drug. S-nitrosylation, the covalent attachment of a nitric oxide (NO) group to a cysteine thiol, mediates redox-based signaling for eukaryotic cellular functions. However, its role in bacteria is largely unknown. Here, proteomic analysis revealed that\u00a0S-nitrosylation is a prominent growth feature of vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus. Deletion of NO synthase (NOS) or removal of S-nitrosylation from the redox-sensitive regulator MgrA or WalR resulted in thinner cell walls and increased vancomycin susceptibility, which was due to attenuated promoter binding and released repression of genes involved in cell wall metabolism. These genes failed to respond to H2O2-induced oxidation, suggesting distinct transcriptional responses to alternative modifications of the cysteine residue. Furthermore, treatment with a NOS inhibitor significantly decreased vancomycin resistance in S. aureus. This study reveals that transcriptional regulation via S-nitrosylation underlies a mechanism for NO-mediated bacterial antibiotic resistance."}, {"title": "Error-related signaling in nucleus accumbens D2 receptor-expressing neurons guides inhibition-based choice behavior in mice", "abstract": "Learned associations between environmental cues and the outcomes they predict (cue-outcome associations) play a major role in behavioral control, guiding not only which responses we should perform, but also which we should inhibit, in order to achieve a specific goal.

Here, using a visual discrimination task in male mice, we assessed the role of NAc D1-/D2-MSNs in cue-guided inhibition of inappropriate responding. Cell-type specific neuronal silencing and in-vivo imaging revealed NAc D2-MSNs to contribute to inhibiting behavioral responses, with activation of NAc D2-MSNs following response errors playing an important role in optimizing future choice behavior.

We find that the redox solvent reorganization energy is insensitive to changes in interfacial field strength. The negatively charged surface attracts adsorbed H as well as H+, increasing hydrogen binding energy, but also trapping H+ in the double layer. While more negative electrostatic potential in the double layer accelerates the oxidation charge transfer, it becomes difficult for the proton to move to the bulk.

However, the pore size of most polymer membranes has been considered an intrinsic membrane property that cannot be adjusted in operation by applied stimuli. In this work, we show that the pore size of an electrically conductive polyamide membrane can be modulated by an applied voltage in the presence of electrolyte via a mechanism called electrically induced osmotic swelling. Under applied voltage, the highly charged polyamide layer concentrates counter ions in the polymer network via Donnan equilibrium and creates a sizeable osmotic pressure to enlarge the free volume and the effective pore size. The relation between membrane potential and pore size can be quantitatively described using the extended Flory-Rehner theory with Donnan equilibrium. The ability to regulate pore size via applied voltage enables operando modulation of precise molecular separation in-situ.

However, understanding the metal-insulator transition (MIT) as a continuous QPT in a\u00a0disordered system has been challenging due to fundamental issues such as the lack of an apparent order parameter\u00a0and its\u00a0dynamical nature. Here, we elucidate the universal mechanism underlying the structural-disorder-driven MIT in 2D semiconductors through autocorrelation and multifractality of quantum fluctuations. The structural disorder causes curvature-induced band gap fluctuations, leading to charge localization and formation of band tails near band edges. As doping level increases, the localization-delocalization transition occurs when states above a critical energy become uniform due to unusual band bending by localized charge. Furthermore, curvature induces local variations in spin-orbit interactions, resulting in non-uniform ferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate that the structural disorder in 2D materials is essential to understanding the intricate phenomena associated with localization-delocalization transition, charge percolation, and spin glass with both topological and magnetic disorders."}, {"title": "Observing and braiding topological Majorana modes on programmable quantum simulators", "abstract": "Electrons are indivisible elementary particles, yet paradoxically a collection of them can act as a fraction of a single electron, exhibiting exotic and useful properties. One such collective excitation, known as a topological Majorana mode, is naturally stable against perturbations, such as unwanted local noise, and can thereby robustly store quantum information. As such, Majorana modes serve as the basic primitive of topological quantum computing, providing resilience to errors. However, their demonstration on quantum hardware has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate a verifiable identification and braiding of topological Majorana modes using a superconducting quantum processor as a quantum simulator. By simulating fermions on a one-dimensional lattice subject to a periodic drive, we confirm the existence of Majorana modes localized at the edges, and distinguish them from other trivial modes.
